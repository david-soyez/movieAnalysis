00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:05,831
Sheldon Cooper's
descent into madness...

2
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:09,315
day two.

3
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,850
It's 2:25 a.m.,

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,787
and I feel the urge to urinate.

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,090
My normal urination time
is 7:10 a.m.,

6
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,027
but here I am,
in the middle of the night,

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,195
struggling to keep my mind sharp

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:26,999
and my pajamas dry.

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,301
It's only a matter of time

10
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:32,872
before my tenuous grasp
on reality fades.

11
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:36,842
I suppose I should pee while
I still know what a toilet is.

12
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,160
Since when do you hum songs?

13
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:55,294
What are you talking
about?

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,595
You were just humming.
Are you sure?

15
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,565
Sometimes when my brain
really gets moving,

16
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,134
it makes noise.

17
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,437
How does your brain feel about
calculating the surface tension

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,705
of the domain walls?

19
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,007
Let's see.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,311
Hey! I<i> was</i> humming.

21
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,514
One point
for Hufflepuff.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,386
What song is that?

23
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,222
Well... Hum it again.

24
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,926
Is that the<i> SpongeBob</i> song?

25
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:31,097
♪ Who lives

26
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,498
Whatever. Can we just
get back to this?

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,866
I feel like I know
what song that is,

28
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,402
but I can't put
my finger on it.

29

No.

30
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,241

46
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:23,056
Hello, yes, I was hoping
you could help me.

47
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:27,628
What song is this?
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la. ♪

48
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,029
You don't know?

49
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,497
Well, how dare you
call yourselves

50
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:33,800
a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

51
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:36,603
My goodness. Do you sing along
to the greatest hits

52
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,906
of Elvis Presley
with that mouth?

53
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,375
Well, they were no help at all.
Which is crazy,

54
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:45,412
since rock and roll is all
about good customer service.

55
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,447
Yeah. So you have a song
stuck in your head.

56
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,715
It happens to everybody.

57
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:50,784
Well, I'm not everybody.
I have an eidetic memory.

58
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:52,986
I should be able to remember
what song this is,

59
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:53,921
but I can't.

60
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,789
Something's wrong with me.

61
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,859
I told you if we were patient,
he'd figure it out for himself.

62
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:01,595
Oh... I was always afraid
this day would come.

63
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:05,199
This might be the first step
of my descent into madness,

64
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,835
where I gradually test
the limits of public nudity.

65
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:10,637
Public nudity?

66
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,874
Eh, that just means
going barefoot.

67
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,784
Hello?
Hi, Dave.

68
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,085
Uh, it's Amy.

69
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,688
Oh. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?

70
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,724
Terrific. And pleasantly
surprised to hear from you,

71
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:33,260
given how I acted
on our last date.

72
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,294
Yeah, well,

73
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,729
we both made mistakes, you know.

74
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:38,699
I took the last breadstick,
you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

75
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:42,903
like he was Leonard Nimoy
and you were my ex-boyfriend.

76
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,272
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

77
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:47,207
Well, I was wondering

78
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,943
if you'd like to get dinner
again sometime.

79
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:51,578
Yes, please.

80
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,448
Great.
Let me just check

81
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,250
my schedule, he said,

82
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:59,086
trying to seem like a man
with things on his schedule.

83
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,388
How 'bout Saturday?

84
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,756
Uh, hmm...

85
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,258
Let me see. Uh, Friday,

86
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,926
farmers' market with Jay Z.

87
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:08,929
Sunday, piano shopping
with Elton John.

88
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,597
Saturday works.

89
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:16,236
Oh. Did you know,
at the United Nations,

90
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,939
there's a Department
for Outer Space Affairs?

91
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,540
Really? Why?

92
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,276
They exist
in case we ever make contact

93
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,677
with an alien civilization.

94
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,214
Mm, boy, that's one of those
jobs that's boring, boring,

95
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,016
boring, then, "Oh, God!

96
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,286
Where's the memo
with what we do now?!"

97
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,955
Oh, this is cool.

98
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,324
So, a few weeks ago,
I set up a fan page

99
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,060
on Facebook for our band and...
Wait a second.

100
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:43,497
How could you do that
without consulting me?

101
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,531
It's not a big deal.

102
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,799
It just took, like,
five minutes to set up.

103
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,401
That's not the point.

104
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:50,237
When we created
Footprints on the Moon,

105
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,940
we agreed that every band
decision would be mutual.

106
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:56,243
Now you're just trying to
take over the whole thing.

107
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,680
You know,
maybe I should go solo.

108
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,715
But someone joined
our page.

109
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,684
We have an actual fan.

110
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,585
All right.

111
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:07,921
This thing's bigger than you
and me-- band's back together.

112
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,491
So, listen to what he wrote.

113
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,294
Uh, "I saw you play
at the comic book store.

114
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,629
You guys rock."

115
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,931
And then there's
a animated smiley face

116
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,133
raising the roof like this...

117
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,637
We did raise the roof
that night.

118
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,272
Yeah, we totally did.
Why do rock stars

119
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,742
do drugs when this feels so great?

00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,434
and do something
else for a while?

128
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:57,571
There was a project I've
been thinking about starting.

129
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,805
Okay, great. What is it?

130
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,974
I'll show you.

131
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:06,580
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon,

132
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,915
you were driven mad
by an earworm.

133
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,284
Your mind,
once your most trusted asset,

134
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:14,254
is now a sack of parrots
and monkeys.

135
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,856
So...

136
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,691
I'm going to tell you
everything you need to know.

137
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,993
Uh, first, music is dangerous.

138
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:23,230
The movie<i> Footloose</i> tried to
warn us, but we wouldn't listen.

139
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,700
Oh, wait.
♪ Everybody cut footloo... ♪

140
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,201
Nope.

141
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:32,539
I'll pay $1,000 to watch you
cut footloose.

142
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,575
This is Penny.

143
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:39,179
She is your friend.

144
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,648
If she offers you food,
it's safe to take it.

145
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,451
You probably
paid for it, anyway.

146
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,655
So, you're really going out
with Dave again?

147
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:49,890
Why not?

148
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,224
He's actually a very nice guy.

149
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,093
But he spent an entire date

150
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:55,429
talking about how much
he loves Sheldon.

151
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,564
That's nothing Sheldon
hasn't done before.

152
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,301
Dave's just a big
fan of his work.

153
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:04,070
Besides, he said he
wouldn't bring it up again.

154
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:06,306
Okay. So where's he taking you?

155
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:09,376
Oh, he's coming here.
I'm actually making dinner.

156
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,445
Oh. That's a big step.

157
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,779
It is?

158
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,215
Yeah. You're inviting him
into your home.

159
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,516
It's intimate.

160
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:19,453
It's where your underpants live.

161
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,788
You know what? Good.

162
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,325
I tried to get back together
with Sheldon; he shot me down;

163
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,726
Dave likes me.

164
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:29,863
Maybe intimate
is what I need.

165
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,164
You sure?

166
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,900
You've never really been
with a man.

167
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:38,138
Do you really want to start
with one that's six-foot-seven?

168
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,240
Why not?

169
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:43,543
'Cause it's like taking
your driver's test in a bus.

170
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,617
Maybe we should post a comment
back to our fan and thank him.

171
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,085
What should we write?

172
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,821
How 'bout, uh...
Oh, how 'bout,

173
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:56,623
"We might be
Footprints on the Moon,

174
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:01,194
but your kind words sent
us over the moon."

175
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:04,764
Someday you're gonna make
an amazing grandma.

176
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,399
What do you
want to write?

177
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:09,436
Something bad-ass,
you know, like...

178
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,471
"Thanks for diggin' our vibe.

179
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,240
"We'll keep rockin'

180
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,576
if you keep rollin'."

181
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:18,078
Dude, if I was wearing a bra,

182
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,881
I'd throw it at
your head right now.

183
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,650
I'll keep rockin'.
You don't do that.

184
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:27,888
Okay. I posted it.

185
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,389
So, who is this guy?

186
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,026
Let's see.
Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

187
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,195
Cool name.
Yeah.

188
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:37,831
He's 24. He's a deejay.

189
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,033
He brews his own beer.
He's got

190
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:43,803
awesome tattoos. Dude, he's
got a hot girlfriend, too.

191
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:48,008
Damn. I don't know if he's
our biggest fan or I'm his.

192
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,778
Hey, Trent just liked
our comment.

193
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,947
He is so cool!

194
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,282
No hard feelings,

195
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,884
but I'm throwing my
hypothetical bra at him.

196
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:13,466
Oh, my God, he won't stop.

197
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:17,137
How does he keep coming up
with new ways to be annoying?

198
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,540
Nobody knows.
That's why he's number one.

199
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,944
Can you please go talk
to him?

200
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,780
Come on. I take care of him all
day long. You do it for once.

201
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,849
Once? Who got the gum
out of his hair?

202
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:33,553
What do you want, a medal?
It was your gum.

203
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,556
Fine.

204
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:37,691
I love you.

205
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,059
Who cares?

206
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,797
What are you
doing in my room? I...

207
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,666
Stop it! That's mine!

208
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,569
Why are you so strong?!

209
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,307
Problem solved.

210
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,087
Oh, yeah,
he got a tuba.

211
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,871
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon...

212
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,873
this is a thermostat.

213
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,110
It controls the temperature
of the apartment.

214
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,847
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

215
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,883
If you find this too cold,
then put on a jacket.

216
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,720
A straitjacket, 'cause 72's
the best and you're crazy.

217
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,756
Now... this...

218
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,625
is your spot.

219
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,861
You're very protective of it.

220
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,829
When anyone else tries
to sit here,

221
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,764
you berate them relentlessly.

222
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:46,468
It sounds mean, but
somehow you make it adorable.

223
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,106
People are also delighted
by your love of pranks.

224
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:54,743
For example, Leonard has no idea

225
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,211
what I did to his coffee.

226
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,482
It wasn't "replace it
with Folger's crystals,"

227
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:02,518
I'll tell you that much.

228
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,154
Hey, can we please
get back to work?

229
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,855
This is Leonard.

230
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,690
He's your best friend
in the world.

231
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:11,093
All right, just stop.
This is ridiculous.

232
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:15,164
Sometimes he gets cranky,

233
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,000
but you can trust him
with your life.

234
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:21,370
And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

235
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:24,573
Thank you.

236
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,808
Oh, no, he's drinking it.

237
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,247
Look at this.

238
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:35,083
Trent is rebuilding
a vintage motorcycle.

239
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,819
Hmm.
That is so cool!

240
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,788
Old broken things
are so much better

241
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,891
than new things that work.

242
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,359
Who's Trent?

243
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,594
Oh, he's our fan.

244
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,696
Fan of what?
Uh...

245
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:51,200
Did you forget?
We're in a band.

246
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,936
You mean because you played one
time in the comic book store?

247
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:57,873
And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

248
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,341
Hey,

249
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,377
dude, Trent just checked in at
the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

250
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,347
Really? You want to go
down there and meet him?

251
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,616
Are you stalking him?
That's creepy.

252
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:08,984
It's not creepy.

253
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,320
I built a Footprints on the Moon
fan page, Trent joined it.

254
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:13,355
After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

255
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,856
go back in the archive
of his feed

256
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,291
until I found
his Twitter handle.

257
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,560
From there, it was easy to find
him on Instagram, Snapchat

258
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,095
and pretty much track
his every movement.

259
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:23,165
So if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

260
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,001
Maybe I should marry Trent.

261
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:29,204
Yeah, like she
could get Trent.

262
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,408
This is delicious.

263
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,643
Thank you.

264
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,246
Been a long time since
I had a home-cooked meal.

265
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,448
When you were married,
did your wife cook?

266
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,116
Not at first, no.

267
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:43,719
But when she began cheating
on me with a French chef,

268
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,021
she became quite the wiz
in t kitchen.

269
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,589
So, a little silver lining.

270
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:48,957
I suppose.

271
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,960
Yeah. Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

272
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:55,464
like a properly-seasoned
bowl of onion soup.

273
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:58,100
How long have you,
uh, lived here?

274
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,102
About five years.

275
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:02,404
I'm actually thinking
of moving to a better place

276
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,773
now that I don't need
to be so close to...

277
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,275
Well, you know.

278
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,176
I do. The brilliant physicist

279
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:11,446
that I now know lives
in the area, not that I care.

280
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,082
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

281
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,585
so, I pretty much had
to take him everywhere.

282
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,353
<i>Had</i> to or<i> got</i> to?

283
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:19,521
Sorry.

284
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:22,024
My fault. I brought him up.
Yeah.

285
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,358
Well, let's change the subject.

286
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,327
No more mentions
of you-know-who.

287
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,062
That's a cool train.

288
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,231
Where did you get that?

289
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,235
♪ Bah, bah, bum-bum,
bah, bum, bum. ♪

290
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,980
This song

291
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,181
is never going to stop.

292
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,716
Have you ever dealt
with something

293
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,319
so relentlessly irritating?

294
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:54,756
That's a trick
question, right?

295
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,291
Well, I shouldn't
be surprised.

296
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,793
There's a rich history of

297
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,461
brilliant minds
descending into madness.

298
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,962
Come on, Sheldon.

299
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,665
There are plenty of smart people
who don't have mental problems.

300
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,800
Yup, she's right.

301
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,768
For every Newton who had
a psychological issue,

302
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,670
there's an Edison
who was just a jerk.

303
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,073
That could
totally be you.

304
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:14,943
Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

305
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,511
And Pythagoras had

306
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,180
an irrational fear of beans.

307
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:20,549
Tesla fell madly in love
with a pigeon

308
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:23,685
who he claimed loved him back.

309
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:26,822
Maybe he just had bread
in his pocket.

310
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,092
The list extends
outside of science.

311
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:33,061
Painters like Van Gogh
and Pollock,

312
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:34,930
chess champion Bobby Fischer,

313
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,899
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boy...

317
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,214
It's called
"Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!

318
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:53,715
Oh, thank goodness!

319
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,118
I'm not crazy!

320
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,787
I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

321
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:04,359
There goes our shot at
him living on the roof.

322
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:09,765
So, all right, there he is.

323
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,768
So, should we
introduce ourselves?

324
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,337
No! Let him spot us.

325
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,872
I wonder

326
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,341
if he's listening
to our music right now.

327
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,642
Could you imagine?

328
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,577
What a cool way
for us to meet.

329
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,047
He's playing our song and
looks up, and there we are--

330
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,252
his favorite two-piece acoustic
sci-fi novelty rock band.

331
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:31,720
And he's, all, like,

332
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,890
"Aren't you the guys from
Footprints on the Moo...?"

333
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,758
Ooh, what is he doing?!

334
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,396
I can't watch.

335
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,998
I-I-It's okay.

336
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,866
Oh, it's okay.
He's done.

337
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,068
Why is he looking at it?!

338
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:51,506
Eh, no, he's not going
to eat it, is he?

339
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,141
Come on, Trent,
you're better than...

340
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,482
Let's just go.

341
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:03,518
Hey, aren't you
the guys...?

342
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,588

Do you even like the Beach Boys?

349
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,836
They have "beach"
right in the name.

350
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,205
What do you think?

351
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,540
Well, now that you can focus
again, what do you say

352
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,476
we get back to surface tension
of domain walls?

353
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:30,145
Of course. I'm already
seeing a more efficient way

354
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:32,481
of taming the ultravi...

355
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,916
I know why
the song was in my head.

356
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:37,486
Why?
It's about Amy.

357
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,855
Okay, look, I know
Amy's like an old lady,

358
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,023
but she's not old enough
to have a song

359
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,125
from the '60s written about her.

360
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,161
It's about
how she made my life better.

361
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,529
Consider the lyrics.

362
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,698
"I was living like half a man.

363
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,167
"Then I couldn't love,
but now I can.

364
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,368
"More soul than

365
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,369
"I ever had.

366
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:56,938
I love the way
you soften my life."

367
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,875
Well, she did soften your life,
didn't she?

368
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,243
Yes!

369
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,812
She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

370
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,415
I have to go.

371
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,553
Aw.

372
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:14,189
Am I like the dryer
sheets of your heart?

373
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,860
Better. You're the
lint trap of my love.

374
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,862
Aw.

375
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,039
That's an interesting
tie clip.

376
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,207
Oh, thanks.

377
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,975
It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.

378
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,878
It's useful for calculating the
number of atoms in a substance,

379
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,782
or causing regret
in anyone who asks about it.

380
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,284
Oh, I...

381
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,953
I think it's neat.

382
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,755
Oh!
Sorry. Sorry.

383
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,723
No one's ever liked
the tie clip before,

384
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,560
so I just lost
all control. I...

385
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:54,162
No, it... it's okay,
and we are on a date.

386
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,598
I'm... I'm just
a little nervous.

387
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,734
Well, no need
to be nervous with me.

388
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,771
I'm just a harmless giant
from a foreign land.

389
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,943
You know, I'm just
being silly. I...

390
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:10,679
I don't know what
I'm waiting for.

391
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,249
Amy?

392
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:15,817
Amy.

393
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:17,085
Amy?

394
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,188
That's Sheldon.

395
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,290
You're kidding!
How's my hair?

396
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,498
Sheldon, this-this isn't
a good time.

397
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,067
I don't care.

398
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,636
Amy, there was a song I
couldn't get out of my head.

399
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:37,839
Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

400
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:42,544
and like that earworm, I can't
get you out of my heart.

401
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:45,313
So, what I'm trying to say is,

402
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:48,383
you're my heartworm.

403
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:53,922
The metaphorical kind, not-not
the poodle-killing kind.

404
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,124
W-W-W-What?

405
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,193
If I may...

406
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:00,328
I believe
what he's saying,

407
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,097
in a charming
and delightful way,

408
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,099
is that he loves you
and wants you back.

409
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,634
Dave Gibbs,
huge fan of your work.

410
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,469
Oh.
Don't mind me.

411
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:13,808
I'm-I'm sorry; I didn't
realize you were on a date.

412
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,544
No, it-it... it's okay.
Keep going?

413
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,180
Amy, if you want to be
my girlfriend again,

414
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,549
I really want to
be your boyfriend.

415
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,319
I really want that, too.

416
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:27,989
Good. Because I love you.

417
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,960
I love you, too.

418
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:36,164
Kiss her,
you brilliant fool!

419
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,614
Well...

420
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:55,083
I'll let you get
back to your date.

421
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,285
Get back here!

422
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,121
♪ Oh, oh, oh, darlin' ♪

423
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:03,425
♪ I dream about you often,
my pretty darlin' ♪

424
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,994
♪ I love the way
you soften my... ♪

425
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,501
Okay, then.

426
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,806
I'll, uh, see myself out.

427
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,442
Amy, thank you for dinner.

428
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:32,846
Dr. Cooper, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

429
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,651
Uh, if perhaps sometime
you have a spare moment,

430
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,287
I'd, uh, love-love
to discuss physics,

431
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,656
or "shoot the breeze,"
as you Yanks say.

432
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,496
Ah. What a lovely evening.

433
