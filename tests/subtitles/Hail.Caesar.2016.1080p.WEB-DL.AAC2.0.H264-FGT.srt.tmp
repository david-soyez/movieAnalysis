2
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,400
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.
it is been...

3
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,300
24 hours since my last confession.

4
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,800
Son, it is so late.

5
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,700
Yeah, Father.
Work has just...

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,100
I lied to Connie.
a, to my wife.

7
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,200
- This is very serious.
- I know.

8
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,300
I promised her I quit smoking

9
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,200
She think's it is bad for me.
And I am trying, but...

10
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Well, I snuck a couple of cigarettes.

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Maybe three.

12
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
Yes.

13
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
it is hard.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,700
Yes.

15
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,400
But I am trying.

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,600
It is 5.00 AM.
Still shank of night for some.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,300
But, for Eddie Mannix,
beginning of a new work day.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,000
The movie studio for which
he works manufactures stories.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Each, it is on daylit dramom,
or moonlit dream.

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,400
But, the work of Essie Mannix
cares not for day or night.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
And cares little for his rest.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,200
that is right now.
Churn that butter for me.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Atto girl.

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,800
Oh, Jesus Christ on a scooter.
You, here?

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,700
The studio has the rights
to Gloria's likeness, Falco.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Give me the negatives and
things will go easier on you.

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Easy.
This is for private use, Eddie.

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,100
Come on.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Oh, boy.

30
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,300
cannot a girl take a few pictures,
have a few laughs?

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,300
Cheez, Eddie.
What a old sss-tick in the mud

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,100
Now, you listen to me.

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
You were at a party,
you had too much to drink.

34
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Somebody brought you here,
you do not remember who.

35
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,700
you are going home now,

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,300
- you name is Mary Jo Schamroth.
- Okay, Eddie.

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,800
So, Eddie Mannix,
saw your heap outside.

38
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,500
Got a call.
Loud, disorderly...

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Possible French postcard situation.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,900
Someone was pulling your leg.
Mary Jo here was just at a costume party.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,900
it is not really her dirndl.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
She wants to contribute something
to your pension fund.

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
Sorry to drag you
out in the rain.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,300
Well, say,
no trouble at all.

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
are not you Gloria DeLamour?

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,500
- No, no. I am Mary Jo... something.
- Schamroth.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Say, Brian.

48
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,400
Can I   a cigarette?

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Ancient Rome.

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,100
12 years into the rule
of Tiberius, ruler Maximus.

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,100
Rome's legions are masters of the world,

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,000
the stomp of it is sandals heard
from the Iberian peninsula in the west

53
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,300
through the halls of the
great library of Alexandria in the east.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,800
As oppressed people everywhere
writhe under the Roman lash,

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,700
freeman and vassal, are united
in one compulsory worship.

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,700
The emperor, Caesar, is Godhead,
lord of every mands body and spirit.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
For those who will not submit,

58
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,900
the galleys, the arenas,
even crucifixion await.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,100
But there is a new wind,
blowing from the east,

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
from the dusty streets
of Bethlehem, that

61
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,500
will soon challenge the
vast house of Caesar,

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,800
that edifice wrought of brick and blood
which now seems so secure!

63
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,400
HAIL, CAESAR!

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,100
HAIL, CAESAR!
A TALE OF THE CHRIST

65
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,900
There she is, Gracchus.
And ah, what a beauty!

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
Aye, Autolochus!
Rome!

67
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Suckled by a she-wolf and
nurturing us, her sons in turn.

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,700
Tonight I bathe in Caracalla,
and wash away

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,400
the dust of three hundred
miles of Frankish road!

70
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,000
To Rome.
To Rome!

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,900
Yes, to Rome!
Glorious center of Caesar's rule!

72
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,700
But far away, in Palestine. . .
another man is coming home.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,700
Saul, humble merchant of Tarsus,
is about to be struck down by a vision.

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,600
What thing is this?

75
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,700
Gloria DeLamour has been checked into
Our Lady of Perpetual Rest to dry out.

76
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,100
You have a 10:00 a.m. with Monsignor ofReilly
at the Wallace Beery Conference Room.

77
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,800
And he is bringing Lester Silkwood
from the Legion of Catholic Decency

78
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,400
and we have also invited Patriarch Vlassos
for the Eastern view.

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
- Have they have read the script?
- Roger.

80
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,700
let us also invite a rabbi, and
a Protestant padre of some sort

81
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,500
- ... so we can get everybody's two cents.
- Check.

82
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,400
how is production on “Tucumcari"?

83
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Principal is on schedule
but second unit has been idle

84
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,900
in Gallup New Mexico for 4 days.
Heavy rain.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
- Forecast?
- Not good.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Send an insert truck and have them shoot
driving plates for “Came the Rain.”

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,900
- Check.
- “Jonah's Daughter” still behind?

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,700
Yes, director says the problem is
DeeAnna and she is getting worse.

89
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,400
I know what it is.
I will drop in on her after my 10 of the clock.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
All right, let us call New York.

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
Mr. Schenk's office, line 2.

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,700
Hi Dorothy, Eddie Mannix.
The old man in?

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,500
Hi, Mr. Mannix, I will check.

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Natalie, I want the box office on
“The Debonaires” and on “Blessed Event.”

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Can you also...
Yes. Good morning.

96
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,000
- how are you doing?
- Mr. Schenk. Very well, thank you.

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,700
- Yeah. how is our productions.
- Proceeding. . . Proceeding. . .

98
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
“Merrily We Dance” starts shooing today.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,900
Beardley Auberon gave us a draft
that is extremely classy.

100
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
Joan Van Vechten is playing Dierdre,
but we need a male lead

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,700
- and we need him now.
- Jack Hogarth available?

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,100
No, Jack Hogarth is
drying out at Cedars.

103
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
- Well, what about Gable?
- Metro will not lend us Gable

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,900
unless we give them
the Kemsky Twins.

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,100
- Now, that am not worth it.
- Of course not, I agree.

106
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,000
What about that kid, Hobie?

107
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
- What?
- Hobie Doyle.

108
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,000
Hobie Doyle?!
Do you really think so?

109
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,200
After all he is-he is a dust actor!
The man barely knows how to... talk!

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,900
- But, people like him, right?
- Yes, of course Mr. Schenk,

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
 I agree, but I do not know if
Hobie Doyle, if he has the...

112
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,200
the... the...
poise in a dinner jacket.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,000
- We need an actor now, am I correct?
- Yes, we do need someone pronto.

114
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,000
- You got a better idea?
- No I do not. that is very true.

115
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,300
Let me talk to Laurence Laurentz,
the director.

116
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
It could work.
It could work.

117
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,000
Hobie Doyle is a very promising idea.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,400
  !

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
And cut!

120
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000
Great, Hobie.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
I can do the handstand smoother
if you give me another shot at her.

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,600
we have got four good ones, Hobie,
and   is tired.

123
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Okay, you are the bossman.

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
If that is lunch I am going to
grab me a plate a beans.

125
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,200
All right kids, this is Rome!

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,700
you are over at this guy's house for
a revel, and in comes Antoninus.

127
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,400
Lots of energy!

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
what are you doing
at the table of viands?!

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
- Ha?
- you are supposed to be reclining, with the lyre!

130
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,500
- I... I am sorry.
- Recline with the lyre!

131
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
do not sit on the pediment.
Recline.

132
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,300
- Relaxed, festive!
- Alright.

133
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
- Extras, set?
- Set!

134
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,200
- Roll sound.
- I got my eye on you.

135
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Roll camera.
Fountain!

136
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,000
Hail, Caesar!
10A . Take 10.

137
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
And action!

138
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Autolochus!

139
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,100
I had heard rumors of
your return to Rome!

140
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,900
More than rumors, noble Sestimus!

141
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,900
I see that you are the
same worshiper of Bacchus.

142
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,400
What gaiety.

143
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,300
There is still truth in the adage,

144
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,700
“What pleasures can not be found
in the villa of Sestimus Ainydias,

145
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,000
can not be found in Rome!”

146
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,300
But seriously, there is talk that
the senate will send our legions out again

147
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,000
and this time not on
a short march to Gaul.

148
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,600
What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus?

149
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
The matter has been
taken up in the Senate.

150
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,900
It seems that there is
unrest in Palestine.

151
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Palestine?
That backwater!

152
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,700
they will hardly be sending the Sixth Legion
to that godforsaken patch of desert!

153
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,800
Palestine.

154
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,100
- Ah hahaha...
- Ha ha ha...

155
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,600
Palestine!

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Holding for a dissolve,

157
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,500
still laughing,

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,400
holding...
and cut.

159
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,000
Fine, boys, that was just fine.

160
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
- Was I alright?
- it is a cut!

161
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
we will move on to the brasier scene.

162
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
Was I alright with the mutterings,

163
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
- I felt a little...
- Nah, it is fine.

164
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Moving on.
Brasier scene, 20 minutes.

165
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,100
Popping over to my trailer.

166
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Okay, in the brasier scene,
they changed “passion” to “ardor.”

167
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
WhatWhy?
I like passion.

168
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,300
it is strong.
it is Passion!

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,300
Such is my greeting after
three months' sojourn in Gaul?

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,200
Not so, Ursulina,

171
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,600
my...
my ardor...

172
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,400
my ardor is yet as warm...
as the embers of this brasier.

173
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,500
The embers of this brasier...
brasier.

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
- they are ready for you, Mr. Whitlock.
- Not so, Ursulina.

175
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Gentlemen, thank you all for coming

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
I know you have parishes, fiocks and temples
making enormous demands on your time.

177
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,500
But I am sure you appreciate also
that great masses of humanity

178
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,100
look to pictures for information
and uplift and,

179
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,100
yes, entertainment.

180
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,500
Now here at Capitol Pictures,
as you know,

181
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,700
 an army of technicians and actors and
top-notch artistic people are working hard

182
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,800
to bring to the screen
the story of the Christ.

183
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
it is a swell story.
A story told before, yes,

184
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,100
but we like to flatter ourselves
that it is never been told

185
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,300
with this kind of distinction and panache.

186
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,700
Perhaps, sir, you forget
its telling in the holy Bible.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
Quite right, Patriarch.
The Bible of course is terrific.

188
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
But, for millions of people,

189
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,400
pictures will be their reference point
for the story, the story's embodiment;

190
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
The story's...

191
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
- Realization.
- Realization.

192
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,600
You “realize,” of course,
that for we Jews,

193
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,100
any visual depiction of the Godhead
is most strictly prohibited.

194
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh.

195
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,000
But of course, for us, the man
Jesus Nazarene is not  .

196
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,500
Ah-ha.

197
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
Who plays Christ?

198
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
A kid we are all very excited about,
Todd Hocheiser,

199
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,000
wonderful young actor we found in
Akron, Ohio in a nationwide talent hunt.

200
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,500
But Hocheiser is seen only fleetingly,
and with extreme taste;

201
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,800
our story is told through
the eyes of a Roman tribune,

202
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,500
Autolochus Antoninus,
 an ordinary man skeptical at first

203
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,400
but who comes to a grudging respect
for this swell figure from the East.

204
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
And Autolochus is played by. . .

205
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
Baird Whitlock.

206
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Oh my.

207
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,900
Well, he is certainly a great talent.

208
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Now, "Hail, Caesar!" is a prestige picture;
our biggest release of the year.

209
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,600
We are devoting huge
resources to its production

210
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,100
in order to make it
first-class in every respect.

211
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,500
Gentlemen, given it is enormous expense
we do not want to send it to market

212
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,200
except in the certainty that it will not
offend any reasonable American,

213
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,700
regardless of faith or creed.

214
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
Now that is where you come in.
you have read the script;

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,400
I want to know if the theological
elements of the story are up to  .

216
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
I thought the chariot scene was fakey.

217
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,900
How is he going to jump from
one chariot to the other, going full speed?

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,300
a-ha, well,
we can look at that.

219
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,200
But, as for the,
religious aspect...

220
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,900
does the depiction of Christ Jesus
cut the mustard?

221
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Well. The nature of the Christ
is not quite as simple

222
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
- ... as your photoplay would have it.
- How so, Father?

223
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,600
It is not the case simply that
Christ is  , or   Christ.

224
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,300
You can say that again!
The Nazarene was not  !

225
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
- He was not not- .
- He was a man!

226
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,900
- Part  .
- No sir!

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Rabbi, all of us have a
little bit of   in us do not we?

228
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,900
- Well...
- It is the foundation of our belief

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,900
that Christ is most properly referred
to as the son of  .

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,300
It is the son of   who takes
the sins of the world upon himself

231
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,100
so that the rest of Gothes children,
we imperfect beings,

232
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,800
through faith,
may enter the kingdom of heaven.

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,100
- So   is. . . split?
- Yes. And no.

234
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,400
- There is unity in division.
- And division in unity.

235
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,800
I am not sure I follow, Padre.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Young man, you do not follow
for a very simple reason:

237
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
these men are screwballs.
  has children?

238
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,300
What, and a dog?
A collie maybe?

239
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,700
  does not have children.

240
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,400
he is a bachelor.
And very angry.

241
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,800
- No, no. He used to be angry!
- What, he got over it?

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,300
- You worship the   of another age!
- Who has no love!

243
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000
Not true!
He likes Jews.

244
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,500
-   loves everyone!
-   is love.

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,300
  is who is.

246
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,200
This is special?
Who is not who is?

247
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,400
But how should   be rendered
in a motion picture?

248
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
  is not in the motion picture!

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Then who is Todd Hocheiser?

250
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,100
Gentlemen, maybe we are biting off
more than we can chew.

251
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,500
We do not need to agree on
the nature of the deity here:

252
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,400
if we can focus on the Christ,
 whatever his... parentage.

253
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,600
My question is:
is our depiction fair?

254
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
I have seen worse.

255
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
Reverend?

256
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,500
There is nothing to
offend a reasonable man.

257
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Father?

258
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,200
The motion picture teleplay was
respectful and exhibited tastefulness and class.

259
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,100
Who made you an expert
all of a sudden?

260
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
And, What do you think, Rabbi?

261
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
Eh.
I have not an opinion.

262
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,300
how did we do?
- I do not... fine. what is up?

263
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,900
cannot find Baird Whitlock.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,700
He left the set
over an hour ago,

265
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,300
said he was going to his
dressing room but he is not there.

266
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
Out on a benderMiddle of the day?
Am I crazy.

267
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,400
you are not crazy, but no.

268
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,900
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's,
Rusty Scupper. Not a soul.

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
- Home, maybeCalled his Wife?
- Yep.

270
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
what did Laura say?

271
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,600
he is not home, he is never home,
he is a louse, try one of his chippies.

272
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,900
- Called that script girl,
what is her name, Francine?
- Check.

273
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
- Any of the gals missing from the set?
- Nope.

274
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,700
Alright, gone an hour?
We will not worry yet.

275
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,600
Hobie?

276
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,000
The Studio says you are finished here
and you are to report back to the Lot.

277
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
- How come?
- they are changing your image.

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay.

279
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,600
And the Studio says  you are escorting
Carlot of Valdez to your premier tonight.

280
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,300
How come?
I do not know her.

281
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,300
Studiofs arranging it,
they are changing your image.

282
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,800
  it!

283
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,100
You have gas again, madam?

284
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,800
madamMiss!
Do I look married?

285
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,200
- No, miss.
- No! Yeah, gas again.

286
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Ask him, he knows.
Alright, scram.

287
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,100
How are you, DeeAnna?

288
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,400
How am I?
Wet.

289
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,900
I do not think I am going to fit
in that fish-  after this week.

290
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Well, we should have the water ballet
in the can after tomorrow;

291
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,400
in the nightclub scene, wardrobe'll have
a gown for you that is more forgetting.

292
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
Any more thoughts about
who you might marry?

293
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,200
I am not doing that again.
I had 2 marriages,

294
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
and it just cost the studio
a lot of money to bust them up.

295
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,400
Well, we had to have those annulled,
one was to a minor mob figure .

296
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,900
Vince was not minor!

297
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,800
And, Buddy Flynn was a bandleader
with a long history of narcotic use.

298
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
Yes, and that is what I am saying,
they were both louses.

299
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,200
Marrying a third louse
am not going to do me no good.

300
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
we have offered you some very suitable,
clean young men.

301
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Pretty boys.
Saps and swishes!

302
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
WhatYou think if there was not a good
reliable man I would not have grabbed him?

303
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,100
What about Arne Seslum?
He is the father, is not he?

304
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,700
Marriage does not have to last forever.
But, DeeAnna,

306
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,300
having a child without a father would present
a public relations problem for the studio.

307
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
The aquatic pictures
do very nicely for us...

308
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,100
So you go and strap on the
fish-  and marry Arne Seslum.

309
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,100
The pictures do well for all of us.
And it is a tribute to you:

310
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,600
the public loves you because
they know how innocent you are.

311
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,900
that is true.

312
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,100
Let me see if Arne is open to
matrimony. you are sure he is the father?

313
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Absolutely. he is the father, yes.

314
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
Pretty sure.

315
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
Hey, Maxie,
bring me my   back!

316
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey, hey.
Buddy, come here.

317
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,300
CAPITOL PICTURES STUDIOS

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,900
- How you doing, Hobie?
- Hello there, Scotty.

319
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,800
They got you shooting on the lot?

320
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,500
Well, Mr. Mannix, pulled me off the Western,
says I am doing a movie on a sound stage.

321
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,700
They built a drawing room.

322
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,100
he is here, Mr. Laurentz.

323
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,400
Ah.

324
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,400
My dear boy, welcome.
Laurence Laurentz.

325
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,800
And you look wonderful, wonderful,
how do you feel?

326
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,800
Well, this here collar...
collar is a little tight.

327
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,700
No no, no, it is nicely fit, looks a marvel,
just takes a little getting used to.

328
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,000
Now, Hobie.
Here is our set.

329
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
And, in fact, that is right, yes.

330
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,200
You enter from there, having
just seen Biff's valise in the foyour,

331
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,000
in spite of Allegra's claim that
he has not been to the house.

332
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
- I am sweet on Allegra.
- Indeed you are.

333
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,700
- But I have seen Biff's grip.
- Indeed you have.

334
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
And so here we find you...

335
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Hobie, we find you haunted by
unspoken suspicions.

336
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,800
Haunted.
By Biffs grip.

337
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,100
By his valise, yes,
but, but,

338
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,900
here is Dierdre,

339
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,400
harboring deep feelings for you,
and sensing opportunity.

340
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,900
- Dierdre.
- Dierdre, yes.

341
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,200
So at her importuning, you join her
on the couch, and conversation ensues.

342
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,700
- So, she is-she is going to importune, Mr. Laurence?
- Laurentz.

343
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh, I am sorry.
She is going to importune, Mr. Laurentz?

344
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,300
Is that something I should be
concerned about?

345
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,800
She shall simply ask you
to join her on the couch,

346
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,800
is all I mean to say,
and conversation ensues.

347
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay, I got you.

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
Very good, very good,
let us try one shall we?

349
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,000
- Sure, I will give her a go.
- Wonderful. Splendid.

350
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,400
The only thing I would suggest is...

351
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:01,000
before your first line, you respond
to her line with a mirthless chuckle.

352
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,500
A mirthless chuckle.

353
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes, I think given your unspoken
suspicions about Allegra,

354
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,500
- A mirthless chuckle.
- a-ha.

355
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,200
- Okay, Mr. Laurence, I will give it a shot.
- Laurentz.

356
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,700
Oh, gosh, I am so sorry, Mr. Laurentz.
I will give it a shot.

357
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,500
“MERRILY WE DANCE”
27A, Take 1

358
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,000
Action.

359
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,300
Oh, Monty.
Come join me on the divan.

360
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,600
It seems Allegra's a no show;
which is simply a bore.

361
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,000
But, I will partner you in bridge.

362
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,500
Why the pout?

363
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Would that it were so simple.

364
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,500
And cut.

365
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,900
that is a cut.

366
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,500
Very good.
Wonderful in fact.

367
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,100
But let us try it
a little differently this time.

368
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,400
- Sure.
- let us try.

369
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,100
Well, let us see, first of all why do not we
dispense with the mirthless chuckle.

370
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,500
- No mirthless chuckle.
- No, no need, really.

371
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,700
It was a bad idea, bad directorial,
my fault, over thinking the thing.

372
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,800
Well if you say so,
but I am happy to do another,

373
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
maybe try her one more time.

374
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,500
I mean if you want that chuckle
I sure want to give her to you.

375
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,800
No no no, completely unnecessary
under the circumstances,

376
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,500
I think the audience can to that
extent they can read your thoughts,

377
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,100
and they,
they will assume your mirthlessness.

378
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,100
- Okay, you are the bossman, Mr. Laurence.
- Laurentz.

379
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, gosh,
I am sorry, Mr. Laurentz.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Also, this time, let us try, actually
looking at Dierdre as we speak,

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,700
looking into her eyes, and speaking our line
with a certain... ruefulness.

382
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,900
- Ruefulness, okay.
- Yes. Because it is not so simple, you see.

383
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,300
- Not so simple as she suggest.
- Okay.

384
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,400
And... Your feelings
are not so simple.

385
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,800
No, sir.
Okay.

386
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
Roll camera.

387
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,600
“MERRILY WE DANCE”
27A, Take 2

388
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
Action.

389
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Oh, Monty.
Come join me on the divan.

390
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,800
It seems Allegra's a no show;
which is simply a bore.

391
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,700
But, I will partner you in bridge.
Why the pout?

392
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,300
Would that?
It were so simple.

393
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,700
Cu... Cut.

394
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Very good. Very good.
Umm.

395
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,800
Come.
Come.

396
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,700
All right, let us try this,

397
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,800
your line, just say it as I say it,

398
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,000
say your line exactly
as I am about to.

399
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
- Just as I am about to do.
- Sure, okay.

400
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Would that itowere so simple.

401
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Would that itowuuuhs so simple.

402
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,400
- Would that itowere so simple.
- Would that itowuuuhs so simple.

403
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,800
My dear boy, why do you say that?
Why do you say, “twuuuua”?

404
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,400
- Well, you said, say it like I say it.
- Yes, but...

405
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,700
Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
- Would that itowere so simple.
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.

407
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Would that it...
Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.

408
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
No, no.
Watch my mouth.

409
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
- Would that itowere so simple.
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.

410
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,600
Keep your head still.
Would that itowere so simple.

411
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
- Would that itowere so simple.

412
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,300
Would...
I am trying to say that, Mr. Laurentz.

413
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
Laurence.
Mm.

414
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,900
I thought...
a minute ago it was Laurentz.

415
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,500
No. We can use Christian names,
my good dear boy, Laurence is fine.

416
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,100
- Just as I call you Hobie?
- Okay.

417
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,700
So.
Would that itowere so simple.

418
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,400
- Would that it twuu...
- Put your hand down.

419
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,100
 “Would that itowere so simple.”
Trippingly.

420
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
Trippingly.

421
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,900
do not say trippingly.
Say the line trippingly.

422
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,800
Would that it twuuuuua...
Would... Would...

423
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
- Would that itowere so simple.

424
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,900
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
- Would that itowere so simple.

425
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,600
Rueful, rueful, rueful.
Hmm.

426
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
- Would that itowere so simple.

427
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,800
- Would...
- Rueful, simple.

428
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,600
- Would that it twuuu...
- Sorrowful simple.

429
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,200
You can say sorrowful.
Rueful. Sorrowful.

430
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,300
- Would that itowere so simple.
- Would that it tw...

431
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,100
- Would that it twuuuuua,
- WhyWhy are you doing this?

432
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,200
- Would that it twuuuuua, so simple.
- Keep still.

433
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,700
Still?! For how long?
What do I tell the director?

434
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
That we are looking for him. But we
do not want it in the gossip columns.

435
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,300
Baird on a bender or in a love nest
or wherever we end up finding him.

436
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,700
As far as the set is concerned
it is business as usual.

437
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,000
Tell the A.D. Baird is out briefiy
with a high ankle sprain.

438
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,500
Fine, but what do we
shoot without him?

439
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
We got the brasier
scene up this afternoon.

440
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,100
Could you get through it shooting around him?
Maybe use his stunt double, Chunk Mulligan.

441
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Chunk cannot act.

442
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,300
Get the writer to trim his speeches.

443
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Well maybe, but then what do we do?
All we got left is the final scene.

444
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,900
Autolochus's speech at the feet
of the penitent thief.

445
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,700
it is the emotional  
of the entire picture!

446
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,300
We got to see Autolochus has
absorbed the message of the Christ!

447
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
- Yeah, I can see that.
- We need Bairthes star power, his charismom.

448
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,600
Sure, his emotional...

449
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,900
This cannot be faked!
it is the heart and soul of the picture!

450
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,000
- I understand.
- End of the film,

451
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,700
we cannot just give that speech to some...

452
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,700
some...
Roman schmoe.

453
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.

454
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,000
But his benders
can last a day or two.

455
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
- What does it cost to shut down?
- Plenty.

456
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,500
You know how big the picture is,
we are on Stages 5 and 14,

457
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,900
if we are carrying everybody
in the final scene

458
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,500
who is up on crucifixes that is 340 an hour
hardship pay, 8 hour minimum.

459
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Plus, we lose...

460
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,300
- Mr. Mannix, I am sorry.
- Not now.

461
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,600
... we lose Todd Hocheiser
to Fox at the end of the week.

462
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,500
should have made him exclusive; who knew.

463
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,400
- Sorry, sir. it is...
- Not now!

464
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,100
it is Mr. Laurentz,
I cannot stop him!

465
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
- Mannix, I will not have it!
- No, no.

466
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,500
For two decades the words
“Laurence Laurentz presents"

467
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,300
- has meant something to the public!
- it is alright, Natalie.

468
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
Okay, Walt, let me know.

469
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,600
what is on your mind,
a... Laurence?

470
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,200
Hobie Doyle can not act!

471
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,100
Hobart Doyle is one of the
biggest movie stars in the world.

472
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,600
On horseback!
But this is a dramom, Mannix.

473
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,300
A real dramom, it is an adaptation
of a Broadway smash!

474
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,500
It requires the skills of a
trained thespian, not a rodeo clown.

475
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,100
I begged you for Lunt!

476
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,800
Mr. Mannix, I am sorry,
but, you wanted me to make sure

477
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
you did not miss your lunch
at the Imperial Gardens.

478
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,600
You never told me who with.

479
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Nuts.
Look, no one wants to see Lunt.

480
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,300
we are not recasting,
this came from Mr. Schenk himself,

481
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,800
it is Hobie Doyle.
Is the boy game?

482
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,800
Oh, he is game.
And gamey!

483
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Well, if he need help,
it is your job to help him.

484
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I will have a talk with Hobie and
take a look at what you have shot,

485
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
but right now,
I have got a lunch.

486
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,200
What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus.

487
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,300
Quiet, Engels.

488
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,900
How pleasant to see you, Mr. Mannix,
your table is right over here.

489
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,700
Thank you, Arthur.

490
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,700
- How you doing, Mannix?
- Mr. Cuddahy.

491
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,300
They mix a   of a Mai Tai.
I like this place.

492
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,800
Sorry to keep you hanging,
it is a tough decision.

493
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,500
Nothing to apologize for, we said
the deal was on the table for a week.

494
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,100
Go ahead.

495
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,500
Nah, I am...
I am trying to quit.

496
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
I just wanted to
visit again to see if

497
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,900
there was some impediment
we could help with,

498
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,700
or if something in the offer
is not clear?

499
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,900
The offer's very clear.
And very generous.

500
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
We want to make it easy
for you to say yes.

501
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,000
Look Mannix, we need a guy with
your talents in management, problem-solving.

502
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,300
And you need to think
about the future.

503
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
Lockheed is booming.

504
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,400
Everyone is riding in airplanes,
and we are moving into jet airplanes.

505
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,600
it is a new age, Mannix,
and we are part of it;

506
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,100
the industry you are in,
what is the future there?

507
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,400
What happens when everybody
owns a television set?

508
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Will they still be going to
pictures every week?

509
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,300
- Well, we like to think that family...
- I do not mean to denigrate.

510
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,200
I am sure the picture business
is pretty   interesting.

511
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,700
But it is also pretty frivolous, is not it?

512
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,100
Aviation is serious;
serious business, serious people.

513
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,800
You will not be babysitting
a lot of oddballs and misfits,

514
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,600
shouldering a lot of crackpot problems.

515
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,500
We have some kooks, sure,
but...

516
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,300
Of course they are kooks,
it is all make-believe.

517
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I told myself I was not going to badmouth
the competition, and look at me.

518
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Sorry, Mannix, I will stick
to what we are about.

519
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Let me show you something.

520
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,500
- Ever heard of the Bikini atoll?
- No.

521
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
A test site, just a couple of
rocks in the middle of the Pacific

522
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,800
until a few weeks ago.

523
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,000
When we blew the Aitch erino.

524
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,100
should not be telling you this.

525
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
it is the real world.

526
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,400
Hydrogen bomb.

527
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,700
Fusion device.

528
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,100
- Armageddon.
- And Lockheed was there. We had a...

529
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
Call for you, Mr. Mannix.

530
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,100
Thank you.

531
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,600
- Hello.
- Mr. Dubrow has a telegram on a kidnapping.

532
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,800
- He has it now?
- Yes, he does. Shall he bring it to you?

533
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,500
No, have him stay on the set,
I will go to him.

534
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,100
Okay, good bye.

535
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.

536
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,200
Still do work there,
for the day anyway.

537
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,000
You make a good case.
I will let you know.

538
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,300
You one of the Hollywood people?

539
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Maybe.

540
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
they are in there.

541
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,300
Please! Enter!
All are welcome!

542
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,200
Ah!

543
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Those things are a nuisance.

544
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,100
Thank you.

545
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,600
we will have sandwiches in a minute.

546
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,500
- Tea?
- Tea?

547
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,100
a. Okay.
Yeah.

548
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,600
- And, a...
- And what is going on?

549
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,600
- Yeah.
- Well, we have just read the minutes

550
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,500
and Tom was about to bring
up new business.

551
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I missed the minutes.

552
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,500
- I would not worry about it.
- they are usually pretty boring.

553
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,900
What kind of a meeting is this?

554
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,600
Well it is not a “meeting,”
so much as a, a...

555
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,400
it is a... more of a,
a study group.

556
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
And you are studying?

557
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,700
Oh, all sorts of jolly stuff.

558
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,600
- History.
- Economics.

559
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,600
Same thing, is not it?
History, economics?

560
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,600
do not you agree?

561
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,500
Well. . . I am. . .
I am not really

562
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
 a studid not of history.

563
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Quiet, Engels.

564
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,000
So...  Thank you.
... man is split?

565
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,900
Well, mands functions are split.

566
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,200
there is the little guy, the regular Joe,
who works for a living.

567
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,900
he is the body,
a. . body politic.

568
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,600
Then there is the brain,
the boss, the owner...

569
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,800
- The boss is not the brain!
- No, no! The boss is parasite!

570
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,100
Well it is true that the boss does not work,
but he has a function.

571
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,000
He controls the means of...

572
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,000
...production, sure, but
that is not a function, that is...

573
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,000
- Parasitism! On the body!
- Shut up!

574
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,300
On the body politic!
Of the regular Joe! it is...

575
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,200
Man is oddity,
a simple economic agent.

576
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,600
Mands institutions are split, expressing
contradictions that must be worked through.

577
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,300
And they are worked through

578
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,800
in a causative, predictable way:
history is science.

579
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,400
This is the essence of the dialectic.

580
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,800
You see, if you understand economics,

581
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,600
you can actually write down
what will happen in the future,

582
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,600
with as much confidence as you
write down the history of the past.

583
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,100
Because it is science.
it is not make believe.

584
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,100
We do not believe in Santo Claus.

585
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,000
Another finger sandwich?

586
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Oh... thank you.
But if I follow this correctly...

587
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,900
who is that guy?

588
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,800
Mr. Smitrovich takes pictures
for our newsletter.

589
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,700
Our understanding of the
true workings of history,

590
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,500
give us access to
the levers of power.

591
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Your studio, for instance, is a
pure instrument of capitalism.

592
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,100
As such it expresses the
contradictions of capitalism,

593
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,900
and can be enlisted to finance
its own destruction.

594
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700
Which is exciting!

595
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,100
It can be made to help
the little guy, the regular Joe.

596
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,800
- The body politic!
- Shut up!

597
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,500
Even though it is purpose
is to exploit the little guy.

598
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,300
- And the body politic.
- You are for the little guy.

599
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
For the little guy, against,
it does not matter,

600
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,500
history will be what it will be,
and we already know what it will be,

601
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,900
- but, yes, we are for the little guy.
- are not you?

602
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,500
- Shut up!
- Are you joking?

603
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,000
Me, for the little guy?
Of course I am for the little guy!

604
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
Is this guy a comedian?

605
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,300
Listen. I better get back,
the studiofs got to be going nuts.

606
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,500
Can we cut it off now and pick it up
right here at the next study session?

607
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,700
Okay, well,
See.

608
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,500
 I am afraid it is not that simple.

609
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,600
And so Baird Whitlock found himself
in the hands of Communists.

610
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,700
Meanwhile, far from the
crashing surf of Malibu,

611
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,900
Eddie Mannix, torn from his lunch
with the Lockheed man.

612
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,200
hurries back to the vastness
of Capitol Pictures,

613
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,800
whose tireless machinery clanks on,

614
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,600
producing this year's ration of dreams
for all the weary peoples of the world.

615
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Hey, numbskull, did not you see
the “Rolling” light was on.

616
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Mannix.
Can I help you find someone?

617
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,400
No.

618
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,800
- Autolochus.
- Yeah?

619
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,300
Why do you present yourself in
my chambers in such humble fashion?

620
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,700
Do not look upon me, Ursulina.

621
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,700
The fires of the brasier of Sestimus
have latterly burned my face!

622
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,500
Though the unguents of Arkimideus
promise shortly to undo the damage.

623
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,900
Autolochus, you knew
that my love is for you,

624
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,700
not for your station.

625
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,800
And my ardor for you is yet
as warm as the embersh of thish bras...

626
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,800
this... this ember...
I am sorry, I am sorry. You know, I am sorry.

627
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,700
"We are the future."

628
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,700
- What does that mean?
- Beats me.

629
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
Somebody slipped it under my door
some time after we broke this morning.

630
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,300
- You mention it to anyone?
- Nope.

631
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,900
Okay, Walt, let us keep it that way.

632
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,200
Hey, by the way.
Chunk sounded good in there.

633
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,900
EDWARD MANNIX
HEAD OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTION

634
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,200
Natalie, could you please get me
Stu Schwartz, Accounting?

635
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
Stu Schwartz on two.

636
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,400
- Stu, how are you?
- Good, Eddie.

637
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,100
- I need some petty cash.
- Okay.

638
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,700
- A hundred thousand.
- A hundred thousand?

639
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,400
- I am sorry, did I say “petty”?
- You did.

640
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,300
Well, it is a long story and
I will tell it to you sometime.

641
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,300
- You have that much in the office?
- Yeah.

642
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,600
How much space will that take up?

643
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
- Mr. Mannix.
- Okay, this might do it.

644
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,600
a. Thora Thacker just came in,
wonders if you have a moment?

645
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,900
Thora Thacker.

646
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,800
Tell her I am stuck on a call.
I will leave through the patio.

647
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,300
Call did not take so long, then.

648
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,800
Yes... no. Fast talkers.
What can I do for you, Thora?

649
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,100
Well, I will be fast too. I only wanted
to notify you as a courtesy

650
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,600
that I am running
my very Whitlock story.

651
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah?
what is the story?

652
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,200
The story. I have a credible source
and I am going to run it,

653
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
and I think you know
what story I mean.

654
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,100
I have no idea.
there is nothing going on With Baird.

655
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,800
- I would know, would not I?
- do not play dumb, Eddie.

656
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,000
I am talking about...

657
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,900
“On Wings as Eagles.”

658
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,400
- What?
- Running it tomorrow.

659
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,300
First of all.

660
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,800
First of all,
there is nothing to that story.

661
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,400
I have heard it, it is been around forever,
and it is never been confirmed.

662
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,100
And secondly, you cannot print that.

663
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,700
Even if you could print it,
you could not print it.

664
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,400
And you would not want to.
Thora, it is beneath you.

665
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,900
The facts are never beneath me.

666
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,300
People do not want the facts,
they want to believe.

667
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,700
that is our great industry,
mine and yours too.

668
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,900
They want to believe that Baird Whitlock
is a great star, and a good man.

669
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,100
- you are admitting he is not.
- No. I am saying he is,

670
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,400
though it is beside the point.
there is nothing to it, nothing to the gossip.

671
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,700
- I AM NOT A GOSSIP COLUMNIST!
- No, no, no. Of course not.

672
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,700
do not confuse me with my sister!

673
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,300
Hardly.
But look...

674
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,100
- Do you have to run it tomorrow?
- it is my entire column.

675
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,400
I am happy to talk to Baird for comment,
but it will have to be this afternoon.

676
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,200
Baird is unavailable right now.
Wait one day.

677
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,400
Thora, wait one day and I will give you
a true story for tomorrow's column.

678
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,800
A little something...
about Hobie Doyle.

679
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,700
My readers do not care about Hobie Doyle.
He wears chaps.

680
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,200
Do they care about Carlot of Valdez?
they are sweet on each other.

681
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,500
You should see the two of them together,
like peas in a pod.

682
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,500
Trade the story of my career for
a puff piece on Hobie Doyle?

683
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,400
- I do not think so.
- you are not trading anything,

684
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,700
you are waiting one day
on a story that is years old.

685
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,700
Wait one day, I can let you talk to Baird
and show you your story's the bunk,

686
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,200
and if I am wrong no skin off
your nose, you run the column.

687
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,200
In the meantime you have an exclusive,
no one else knows about Hobie and Carlot of.

688
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,500
No kidding.
you are it.

689
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,500
What kind of name is Thora, anyway?

690
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,200
it is a name that
19 million readers trust.

691
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,800
do not play games with them, Eddie.

692
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,400
Oh, no body's playing games here.

693
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Is that big enough?

694
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,600
Hello Eddie, I am notifying you as a
courtesy before I run tomorrow's story.

695
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,000
Thessaly, I just saw your...
never mind.

696
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,400
- how are you doingwhat is the story?
- it is about Baird Whitlock.

697
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,800
There is absolutely no truth
to that old story, believe me!

698
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,000
- Old?
- Old. Stale. Rotten.

699
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,100
I am talking about today.

700
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
What?

701
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,100
A little bird told me that
he disappeared from the set today.

702
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,600
Oh! That. No, no, yes,
he did have to take a break.

703
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,200
- Minor injury, high ankle sprain.
- What did you think I meant?

704
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,000
No, nothing.
I saw your sister earlier,

705
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,400
 she was trying to resurrect
some old gossip about Baird.

706
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,300
Oh, I am sure she was.
That cow.

707
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,900
She would not know a news story
if it bit her on the posterior.

708
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,700
- Yeah. Well, she is...
- High ankle sprain?

709
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,500
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

710
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,500
We all know about the womanizing

711
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,700
 and the drinking jags and
the trips to San Berdoo.

712
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,000
Baird is a good family man.
He has a high ankle sprain.

713
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,900
Mr. Mannix!

714
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,000
- what is up, Peanut?
- Natalie told me to find you PDQ.

715
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,900
I know it sounds screwy, but she said
someone's calling from the Future.

716
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,700
The futh... Good lord.
Thessaly, I have to run.

717
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,400
If you do know where Baird is,
you must let me talk to him.

718
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,800
Sure, I will find out where he is, right away,
Thessaly, and I am sure...

719
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,700
Say, what kind of name
is Thessaly, anyway?

720
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,600
it is a name that 20 million readers trust.
They want the truth, Eddie.

721
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,900
The Truth.
Yes.

722
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,700
we are going to give it to them.

723
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,100
- On 3. And Hobie Doyle is in there.
- Right.

724
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,700
- Hello, Mr. Mannix.
- Thanks for coming, Hobie.

725
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,300
One second.

726
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,700
Hello, Mannix...

727
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,700
 .

728
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,600
Hung up, Natalie.
Tell me the second they call back.

729
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,000
Yes, sir.

730
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,300
what is going on there, Mr. Mannix?
Looks like you are expecting rain.

731
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,100
Nah, it is... nothing.

732
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,200
how is the first day on the picture?
Getting comfortable?

733
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,400
Oh, I guess it is going pretty good,

734
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
that Mr. a... Laurentz,

735
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,100
he is an awful good man,
he is helping me get through it,

736
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,800
I give him all the credit in the world,
me the new hand in the bunkhouse,

737
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,700
they got me talking a lot
which takes a little...

738
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,600
getting use to,  talking with the camera
looking at me but heck I enjoy.

739
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,800
Oh, good, that is fine.

740
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Usually on a picture I just say
“ !” or “Whoa, there,”

741
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,900
but, this-here it is talking,

742
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,700
and it is people listening,
that threw me little at first

743
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,100
but I think I got my leg up
onner now.

744
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
that is fine. Laurence came in this morning
to tell me how well you are doing.

745
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,900
You just continue to do
whatever he says.

746
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,800
He knows how to make
a quality picture.

747
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,700
That is true, he will not quit
on a take until it has quality.

748
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,400
Is that them?

749
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,300
Sorry sir, no,
do you want Mrs. Mannix on 1?

750
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,100
- Hi, hon.
- Hi.

751
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,900
Oh, you know, busy.

752
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,900
a-ha.

753
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,100
a-ha.

754
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,100
I thought he asked to play infield.

755
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,400
I see.

756
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,000
Well maybe we should make
him honor that commitment.

757
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,400
that is true.
Of course you are right.

758
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,800
Okay.
Okay, I will call the coach.

759
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,300
- Sure.
- Love you.

760
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,300
I love you too.

761
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,900
Mr. Mannix, you want me to
run out and get you a bigger grip?

762
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,400
That one looks a little bit snug.

763
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,600
Hobie.

764
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,000
there is a hundred thousand dollars
in that attache case.

765
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,700
Ransom money.

766
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,100
Baird Whitlock has been kidnapped.

767
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,500
This is bad.

768
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,300
Bad for movie stars everywhere.

769
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And you got no idea
who is mixed up in this thing?

770
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,200
- I would look at the extries.
- The extras. Why?

771
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,200
Well, you just never know
about an extrie.

772
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,500
They come and go.
Every one else, I am on the set,

773
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,800
I see the guy setting the 5K I think,
“Why, there is old Bud, setting the 5K.”

774
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,400
Script girl, wrangler, same thang.

775
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,200
Extries, that is different.

776
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,100
Not making a blanket call here, I mean,
there is good extries and bad extries.

777
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,500
All I am saying.

778
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,600
You look at an extrie,

779
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,900
you got no idea
what he is thinking.

780
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,200
he is back, line 2.

781
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,100
- Hello.
- Do you have the money?

782
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,800
- Yes, I have it.
- Stage 8.

783
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,200
- Stage 8.
- Behind the electrical box.

784
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,500
Behind the electrical box.

785
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,900
- Just leave it there?
- Right.

786
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
- When do I get Baird?
- When we have the money.

787
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,800
I will do it right now.

788
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
Can I use your belt?

789
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,000
SWINGIN'
DINGHY

790
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,600
The 'SWINGIN' DINGHY' is closing, folks.

791
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,000
Time for me to clean up.
Time for you to clear out.

792
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,600
So long, fellas.
See you in 8 months.

793
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,200
- See you later.
- Later, boys.

794
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,300
8 months?

795
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,200
Yeah, we are shipping out
in the morning.

796
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,600
Golly!
8 months without a dame.

797
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,200
- Can you beat it?
- You going to have to beat it.

798
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,800
We are heading out to sea

799
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,600
and however it will be,

800
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,200
it am not going to be the same.

801
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,800
cause no matter what we see,

802
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,100
when we are out there on the sea,

803
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,000
we am not going to see a dame.

804
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,100
we will be searching high and low

805
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,600
on the deck and down below

806
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,000
but it is a crying shame.

807
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Oh, we will see a lot of fish

808
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,600
but we will never clock a dish.

809
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,000
We am not going to see a dame.

810
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,100
No dames!

811
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,200
we might see some octopuses

812
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,100
No dames!

813
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,300
or a half a dozen clams

814
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,100
No dames!

815
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,600
we might even see a mermaid

816
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,300
But mermaids got no gams!

817
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,100
No gams!

818
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,800
Hey, get off of there.

819
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,400
Hey, come one.

820
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,600
Hey!
Come on.

821
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,900
Hey!

822
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,500
Oh, come on.
Oh, Christ.

823
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,200
Oh, come on!

824
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,500
Have I got a girl for you.

825
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,700
out there on the sea!

826
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,800
here is how it will be

827
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,000
I am going to dance with you, pal

828
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,500
you are going to dance with me!

829
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,200
When we are out there on the sea

830
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,000
we will be happy as can be

831
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,600
Or so the Captain claims!

832
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,400
But we have to disagree.

833
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,800
Cause the only guarantee

834
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,400
Is I will see a lot of you

835
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,100
And you will see a lot of me!

836
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,500
And it is absolutely certain
That we will see a lot of sea.

837
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,700
But we am not going to see 
no dames.

838
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
No dames! 
we are going to sea!

839
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,100
No dames! 
we are going to sea!

840
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,400
No dames! 
we are going to sea!

841
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,100
We am not going to see

842
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,700
No...

843
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,700
This place looks open!

844
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,500
What the...

845
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,300
You, out.

846
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,700
- Stop.
- Hey!

847
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,100
Cut that out.
This am not that kind of a place.

848
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,600
Cut!

849
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,000
- Ah, okay.
- Okay, kids, back to one.

850
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,600
Okay.

851
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,800
Come here, Burt Gurney.
We go again.

852
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,300
Anything different, Mr. Seslum?

853
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Yah, yah, yah, No, no, no.
Mostly pretty good, but this time...

854
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,500
do not put dish rag on bartender's head.

855
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,200
you are a big star, Burt Gurney.
Who cares about the bartender.

856
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,700
You are the star.

857
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,600
- that is my whole character, this little bird.
- Mr. Seslum, I do not mind if he...

858
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,700
- It is decided.
- Hello, Burt.

859
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,700
Hello, Mr. Mannix.

860
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,500
- Arne.
- Hello.

861
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,000
Listen, I do not want to stick my nose
in other people's business,

862
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,900
but, a, I understand you have been...
associating with DeeAnna Moran?

863
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,400
- Yah, yah. We associated.
- Yes.

864
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,400
But no more. No more.
do not you worry, Eddie Mannix.

865
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,100
But Arne, you are aware that she is...

866
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,300
This must not be in movie magazines,
that we associated.

867
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,800
- No, no, of course not.
- My wife can not read this.

868
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,600
Your...excuse me?

869
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,400
Ilsa Pfiug.

870
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,300
- Ils...
- Ilsa Pfiug Seslum.

871
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,900
In Malmo.

872
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,900
- I was not aware of that.
- Yah, two children.

873
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,000
Well, a third on the way, apparently.

874
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,600
Do you enjoy physical culture,
Eddie MannixDo you ski?

875
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,000
No, I, a, never took it up.
Seems like a lot of fun.

876
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,600
I no more associate with DeeAnna Moran.
I hug you.

877
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,200
Good bye.

878
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,100
I spent the night.

879
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,200
So I feel somebody poking at me
and I wake up

880
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,800
and it is Clark.
And he says,

881
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,500
"Well, your keys are not in there,
so I guess we are walking."

882
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,500
This was back before
Gable was Gable.

883
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,300
We used to go to San Berdoo
every weekend,

884
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,400
Bob Stack would come up sometimes,
 the Blue Grotto was still open.

885
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,400
Dave Chasen was a busboy.

886
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
Quite a place!
Yours?

887
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,200
Oh, gracious no.

888
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,400
It belongs to a member of our study group.
He could not be here this afternoon

889
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,000
he shall be sad to have missed you.

890
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,100
- he is a fan.
- a-ha. that is swell.

891
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,700
So, I black out,
I wake up here

892
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
and I say to myself,

893
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,400
 Baird, you got to stop doing this,

894
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,000
but you are saying, actually, technically
I was kidnapped.

895
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,600
Well... technically, yes.

896
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,300
- And there is going to be a ransom.
- I would hardly call it a “ransom.”

897
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,000
Benedict there, that is Benedict de Bonaventure,
he wrote “The House of Ahasuaris.”

898
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,800
Enormous hit.
Made the studio millions of dollars.

899
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,300
Did you see any of those
millions of dollars, Ben?

900
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,700
I did not.

901
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,800
Dutch over there, Dutch Zweistrong wrote
“All The Way To Uruguay”.

902
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,900
I wrote all the “All The Way” pictures.

903
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,100
All successful.
You see any of the profits, Dutch?

904
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,500
- HA!
- All of us here are writers.

905
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,500
The pictures originated with us,
they are our ideas,

906
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,000
but they are owned by the studio.

907
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:57,900
I am not saying only writers are being exploited,
I mean, look at yourself, Baird.

908
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,600
Oh, you know, the studio
takes pretty good care of me.

909
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,100
what are you, a child?

910
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,500
I think what Herschel's trying
to say is—

911
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,800
just because the studio
owns the means of production,

912
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,200
Why should it be able to
take the money... our money,

913
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,600
the value created by our labor,
and dole out what it pleases?

914
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:23,400
that is not right. So, no. No,
I would not call it “ransom.”

915
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,000
- Payback.
- that is right.

916
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Now, until quite recently
our study group had a narrow focus.

917
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,600
We concentrated on getting
communist content into motion pictures.

918
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,900
Always in a sub Rosa way, of course.

919
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,400
And we have been pretty darn successful.

920
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,300
You remember, in “Kerner's Corner”,
the Town Hall scene,

921
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,900
where the aldermen overturn the rotten
election and make Gus the mayor?

922
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,800
Yeah.

923
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,000
I like to think we have changed a few minds.

924
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,900
But, then.
Well.

925
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,300
Then Dr. Marcuse came down from
Stanford, joined the study group.

926
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,300
And started teaching us
about direct action.

927
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,100
- Praxis.
- Action.

928
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,100
We each pursue our own
economic interest,

929
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,800
we ourselves are
not above the laws of history.

930
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,200
But in pursuing our interest with
vigor,

931
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,500
we accelerate the dialectic,

932
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:23,600
and hasten the end of history
and the creation of the New Man.

933
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,700
- Plus, we make a little dough.
- Shut up !

934
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,800
we are not even talking about money,
we are talking about economics.

935
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,400
Sure.
Good.

936
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,400
Good stuff.

937
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,900
So... now, do I get
a... share of the ransom?

938
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,400
Well,

939
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,800
no, Mr. Whitlock. You could hardly
share in your own ransom.

940
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,400
That would be unethical.

941
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,900
Well, it does not seem fair, fellas!

942
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I mean, the whole set-up only
works if I play along, right,

943
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,100
if I do not let on that I know
who kidnapped me?

944
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,000
Yes, that is right.

945
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,400
What if I named names?

946
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,000
Mmm. If I...
Just I... tell the truth?

947
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,600
I do not think you will do that,
Mr. Whitlock.

948
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,300
What if we told the truth about...

949
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,400
“On Wings as Eagles”?

950
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,700
Sid.

951
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,400
we have to work something out
for DeeAnna Moran.

952
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,600
- She get married again?
- No, that is the problem.

953
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,200
- Having a child, not married.
- Tough.

954
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,700
Yeah.
No father.

955
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,400
Well, of course there is one,
somewhere. . .

956
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,000
- But who knows.
- Exactly. So, is there any way,

957
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,000
I am just spitballing here,

958
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,700
any way she could adopt
her own child?

959
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,000
- Interesting.
- As a single...

960
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,300
- She disappears for a while, reappears.
- a-ha.

961
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,700
And she wants to share her blessings,
adopt a child.

962
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,100
Sure, she is always...
yearned to be a mother.

963
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
- that is it.
- Well I do not see why not.

964
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,400
Nothing in California statute prohibits
adoption by one's own parent.

965
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,900
This is new ground.
Technically, she had have to

966
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,600
give up the baby
to a third party.

967
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,200
- Joe Silverman.
- Joe Silverman. Exactly.

968
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,600
he is the foster father,
for a few days.

969
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,100
She hands the kid to Joe,
he hands it back.

970
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,400
- I will do some research.
- Alright.

971
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,800
- Mr. Mannix, it is 5:30.
- This is exciting.

972
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,800
... and asked all the assistant directors.

973
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,500
One of them said that an extra

974
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,400
in the courtyard of
Sestimus-Aniydias scene seemed jumpy.

975
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,300
All right, get Walt the name of the extra
so he can bring him in and sweat him.

976
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,100
Walt should tell him
we will not press charges

977
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,000
- if he tells us where Bairthes been taken.
- Check.

978
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,100
If he plays dumb, or if the A.D.'s wrong
and he is dumb,

979
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,700
- ...check the other extras
- Check.

980
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,600
Thessaly Thacker called, said you promised
her an interview with Baird today.

981
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,300
- Check that, it was Thora Thacker.
- No, it was Thessaly.

982
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,100
Tell her, he was at the doctor
longer than expected,

983
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,900
she can see him on the set
bright and early tomorrow.

984
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,000
- Check. And is that last part true?
- let us hope so.

985
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,600
That reminds me:
I need a list of everyone

986
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,900
who worked on “On Wings as Eagles”
who is still at the studio.

987
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,300
“On Wings as Eagles”,
that is a while ago, now.

988
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,500
Aside from Baird and the director
it will not be a long list.

989
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,300
- Yeah, get it for me. That it?
- No.

990
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,400
One more thing:
a Mr. Cuddahy called, said you know him.

991
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,200
- Yeah yeah.
- Said it is urgent he see you one last time.

992
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,500
Suggested same place,
seven this evening.

993
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,900
WhyNever mind.
Okay, tell him I will be there.

994
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,400
- Back to your place?
- Oh...

995
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,500
- Hello, CC.
- I rather thought we might go to...

996
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,500
Oh, hi, Eddie.

997
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,200
want to lace up what you got
on “Merrily We Dance”?

998
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,300
it is up now.
I will put some music on it.

999
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,500
Laurence Laurentz
presents

1000
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,600
Merrily
We Dance

1001
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,700
Taxi!

1002
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,700
- Back to your place?
- Oh, what a bore.

1003
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,000
I rather thought we might go
to Lake Onega for the weekend.

1004
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,500
Just the two of us.

1005
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,800
I do not have my valise
I left it in your foyour.

1006
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,100
- Oh, you will get by without a change.
- Suits me.

1007
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,100
If you do not mind skipping out
on your own party, Allegra.

1008
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,600
- Suits me.
- And skipping out on Monty.

1009
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,500
That suits me as well.

1010
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,600
Oh, poor Monty.

1011
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:44,100
- What Monty does not know.
- will not hurt Monty.

1012
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,300
Oh, Monty.
Come join me on the divan.

1013
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,400
It seems Allegra's a no show,
which is simply a bore.

1014
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,100
But, I will...

1015
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,600
Reverse...

1016
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,100
Reverse.
Reverse.

1017
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,300
I should not wear scarves.

1018
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,200
It seems Allegra's a no show,
which is simply a bore.

1019
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,700
But, I will partner you in bridge.

1020
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,700
Why the pout?

1021
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,900
it is...

1022
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,300
complicated.

1023
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
How pleasant to see you again,
Mr. Mannix.

1024
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,400
- Thanks for coming back, Mannix.
- Sure.

1025
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,700
you are taking us down to the wire, are not you?

1026
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,600
it is not a ploy.
it is a big decision.

1027
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,200
Absolutely!
No foul.

1028
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,900
But the board was concerned when I
could not give them a yes this afternoon,

1029
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,800
so, they have authorized me to say this.

1030
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,900
You sign on,
your term of contract is 10 years.

1031
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,400
Yeah.
You get it, right?

1032
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,800
That means your stock options are
guaranteed to vest.

1033
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,600
you would never have to work again,
if you chose to retire after your term.

1034
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,600
Think about it.

1035
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
Life time employment.

1036
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,900
You would not be a glorified
working stiff like you are now.

1037
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,700
you will be running a business,
not a circus.

1038
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,300
Drink?

1039
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,900
Cigarette?

1040
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,800
No, no.
I got to run.

1041
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,400
I should talk this over
with my wife.

1042
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,600
Of course, talk it over,
think about your family,

1043
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,200
let us know in the morning.

1044
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,800
Oh!

1045
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,800
If you think this is a bribe,
you are absolutely right.

1046
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,500
You have two kids, right,
a boy and a girl?

1047
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,400
that is right.

1048
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,700
They love this stuff.
Used to be trains.

1049
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,500
Hello, Hobie.

1050
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,300
Oh, hello, Carlot of.

1051
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,900
- Am I late?
- Oh no, it am not nothing.

1052
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,300
Thanks an awful bunch for
coming to this picture with me,

1053
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,500
I do not know if you like livestock
but I think it is got moments

1054
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,200
I really do.
You look very pretty

1055
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,700
Well, thank you, Hobie.

1056
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,900
I am sure I will like the picture
I like all of your pictures.

1057
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,400
Well, I like yours too,
they are just the craziest things

1058
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,000
Is it hard to dance with all
them bananas on your head?

1059
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,500
Oh, no.
Anyone can do it.

1060
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,300
it is all in the hips and the lips
and the eyes and the thighs.

1061
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,800
Little Eddie wanted me to
tell you about his baseball game.

1062
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,400
They won.

1063
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,400
that is terrific.

1064
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,700
I should have never called the coach!
Eddie played at shortstop?

1065
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,300
Mm, and he did so well,
he wants to stay there now.

1066
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,600
Great, it took care of itself.

1067
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,300
And Darlene did very well
on her Spanish test.

1068
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,200
that is good, she was worried about that.

1069
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,000
Thanks for heating up the roast, hon.

1070
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,100
- Warm glass of milk?
- No, thanks, hon. Coffee.

1071
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,600
I have got to run back to the studio,
a few things to take care of.

1072
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,900
Gee, another late night.

1073
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,800
Mm.

1074
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,500
You know. . .
Lockheed improved their offer.

1075
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,000
Darned good money. And the hours
would not be crazy like this, either.

1076
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,600
it is nice to be wanted.

1077
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, sure, but...

1078
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,900
what do you think?
They want to know tomorrow.

1079
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,700
I like the shorter hours.

1080
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,200
But what do you think, honey?
You know best.

1081
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,900
how is it going with the smoking, dear?

1082
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,000
Oh, you know...

1083
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:41,200
The denizens of Los Angeles
make ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

1084
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,400
But Eddie Mannix will have neither.

1085
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,200
Even in westerly Malibu
the sun has moved on,

1086
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,300
leaving the vast and tireless sea
to heave itself blindly upon the shore.

1087
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,400
The communists welcome
a rare moment of leisure.

1088
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,400
A brief surcease from struggle.

1089
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:13,500
Baird Whitlock has become their acolyte,
a convert to their cause,

1090
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:17,300
his belief compelled
but not grudging.

1091
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,200
He now seeks to learn more
from professor Marcuse

1092
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,000
and becomes ever more committed
to the quest

1093
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,800
to hasten an end to history
and bring on the New Man.

1094
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,600
that is exactly what I was talking about

1095
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
that is what happened to me
when I went to Reno with Danny Kaye

1096
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,500
and he asked me
to shave his back!

1097
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,400
Exact same thing!
Because I am thinking, who benefits?

1098
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,900
Also, I got to tell you,
everybody thinks Danny is a  

1099
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,500
he is not really a  , it is just the theory
generating its own anti-theory.

1100
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,700
Anyway, there we were,
it is me and Danny,

1101
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,700
and I am wondering what the  
am I doing with a razor in my hand

1102
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,200
he says it is for a
Norman Taurog picture

1103
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,600
but Judy Canova is there
and she knows Norman.

1104
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,000
She says, "Danny is not doing
a Norman Taurog picture,

1105
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,400
he just wants you
to shave his back."

1106
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,900
And that is who benefits.

1107
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,200
HOBIE DOYLE
"Lazy OL' MOON"

1108
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,400
In livelier precincts,
the swells of Dreamland

1109
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,100
gather to inspect the completed
weave of another piece of gossamer.

1110
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:22,700
Another movie, another portion of balm
for the ache of a toiling mankind.

1111
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,100
- Where is she?
- Hold your horses, I am right here.

1112
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,700
what is on your mind, Curly?

1113
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:36,300
Not my fault you saw me take
that pie off the sill,

1114
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,400
Not your fault?
who is fault was it, Curly?

1115
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:44,100
Why that...
crazy lazy full moon!

1116
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,100
2 weeks ago,
you would never see me take it.

1117
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,900
Darn you, moon.
What good are you anyway.

1118
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,600
do not know about this part, they
only gave me one shot at the song.

1119
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,000
I wished there never was no moon.

1120
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,900
I wished there were not
no bossy ol' women.

1121
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,200
do not blame that moon, Curly.
She cannot do nothing but shine.

1122
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,100
Lazy ol' moon keep shining.

1123
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,000
Darn you.

1124
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,700
You turn Curly Stirling in
to the authorities

1125
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,500
for the last time.

1126
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:26,200
Lazy ol' moon keep shining.

1127
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:34,000
pining just to be

1128
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,800
On that old plantation,

1129
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,100
where I used to roam

1130
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:47,100
Light my weary way back home.

1131
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Darn, where did she go?

1132
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,400
Lazy Old Moon keep shining,

1133
01:13:54,700 --> 01:14:01,000
shining down for me

1134
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,600
Another part of town,
another cast of characters.

1135
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,000
Another task, for Eddie Mannix.

1136
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,500
JOSEPH SILVERMAN
SURETIES
BONDS . ESCROW

1137
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,600
... done before,
which is not to say they were...

1138
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,700
Ah, we are just getting started,
I have been taking DeeAnna through this.

1139
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,800
So Joseph has done...

1140
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,600
well, just a whole lot of
good work for us in the past

1141
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,800
Whenever we have needed a witness
or a third party for,

1142
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,500
I do not know, a petition of grievance
or alienation of affection.

1143
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,800
- And he is reliable?
- I am bonded, miss.

1144
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,300
Joseph Silverman is the most reliable human being
on the planet, in our experience.

1145
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,500
When Chubby Cregar was intoxicated
and hit that pedestrian on Gower,

1146
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,300
we had that vehicle title
transferred to Joe's name

1147
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,800
and Joe did 6 months
in LA County lock-up.

1148
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
But you are off the sauce now?

1149
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,700
I never touch it.
It was a legal action.

1150
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,000
that is right.

1151
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,200
When the studio needs someone
who meets the legal standard of...

1152
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,200
- how did you put it, Sid?
- Personhood.

1153
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,900
 Joe steps in and acts as the,
a. . . person.

1154
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,200
So you are a professional. . . person?

1155
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,900
that is right, miss.
Initial here, and here.

1156
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,700
Joe will be the foster parent
until such time as

1157
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,500
you adopt the child, which you can do
as soon as Joe takes possession of it,

1158
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,100
- And he is reliable?
- I am bonded, miss.

1159
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,100
The release papers you are signing
will not be a matter of public record.

1160
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,700
all these documents will be sealed,
until the year 2015.

1161
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,000
- And no one's the wiser.
- No one the wiser

1162
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,900
No fans. No press.
No court officials.

1163
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
- Not even a notary public.
- Joe himself is the notary.

1164
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,600
You must have very strong forearms.

1165
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,100
Is it hard, squeezing it like that?

1166
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,700
it is part of the job, miss.

1167
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,900
- Late night, Mr. Mannix?
- A late night for both of us.

1168
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,500
Will you call Projection 7 and have them
lace up yesterday's dailies on “Hail, Caesar!”

1169
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,200
Sure thing.
Yesterdays

1170
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,900
Thanks, Scotty.

1171
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,900
Roman before slaves!

1172
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Make room!
You fools!

1173
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,200
Roman before slaves!

1174
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,400
Roman before slaves!

1175
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,100
Make room!

1176
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,100
- how is that, what did you think?
- Cut!

1177
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,400
- “Hail Caesar, 27 Baker Two.”
- Action!

1178
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,200
Go ahead, I am listening.

1179
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,800
Walt talked to the extra, right guy,

1180
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,900
no info,  does not know
where they took Baird,

1181
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,800
but described the truck
they put him in.

1182
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,700
Cut!

1183
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,900
Walt found the guy who owns
the truck and is talking to him.

1184
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,900
Baker 4.

1185
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,500
- Waltos a problem-solver, he is a good man.
- Action!

1186
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,000
What else?

1187
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,900
PR just called in their report on
Hobie Doyle premier: Warm reception.

1188
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,900
I felt something like
I had some spittle.

1189
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,700
- Baker 6.
- Action!

1190
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Okay, he is terrific.

1191
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,400
Squint!
Squint against the grandeur.

1192
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,400
he is blinding, blinding!

1193
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,900
Right.
let us see what we can do here.

1194
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,500
Okay.

1195
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,600
Well, I do not think it is regulation size
but, it will have to do.

1196
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,400
You ever hear of origami
the Japanese do?

1197
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,500
a-ha.

1198
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,200
- This here is Italian origami.
- Yeah.

1199
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,500
See.
Now, you just...

1200
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,400
let us see how she does now.

1201
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,500
Oh, she is peeking back.

1202
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,600
Hoh, there she goes.

1203
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,500
Oh, she is bawling.

1204
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,700
Clear!

1205
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,900
This is why I never order it
with meat sauce.

1206
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,900
- how did you get into pictures, Hobie?
- Got roped into it.

1207
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,400
Stop.

1208
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:40,400
Stop... playing...
with your... food.

1209
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,500
food!

1210
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,800
- you are the one playing with it.
- Stop it.

1211
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,200
Pictures.
Well, I wrangled for a while

1212
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,400
and then they saw
I could say a line or two.

1213
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,700
and I was Bad Clem
or Deppity Number Two

1214
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,900
or the guy's buddy for a couple of years
and then someone heard me singing,

1215
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,400
they made me the guy.

1216
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,900
you are awfully cute.

1217
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,600
Aw heck, you am not seen
the half of it

1218
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,900
I will show you cute,
just a second here a little.

1219
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,900
souvenir from my rode days.

1220
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,800
Tell you what,
I was steer busting

1221
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,600
and I went down,
the steer went up,

1222
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
and my teeth headed off
for east Texas.

1223
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,100
Here, it is coming round again.

1224
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,900
- You got to give a little.
- Take a little.

1225
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,900
- And let your poor heart break a little
- And let your poor heart break a little

1226
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,500
that is the story of,
that is the glory of love

1227
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,900
(Attache case with my belt...
Ransom money)

1228
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,300
you have got to laugh a little, cry a little,

1229
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
let the clouds roll by a...

1230
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,700
(Thessaly Thacker)
Well now, this is interesting.

1231
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,300
(Thessaly Thacker)
I did not know you two were friends.

1232
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,900
Aw heck yeah, we-we just caught
my picture, “Lazy Ol' Moon”

1233
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,200
And I guess we are...

1234
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,200
Yes, we are friends,
we are...

1235
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,900
Well, we are fixing to be friendly,
tell you that.

1236
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,300
that is good: “Fixing to be Friendly”
That can be my column headline.

1237
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,300
- Well, I guess that had be okay.
- Have a good evening.

1238
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,300
I mentioned the name of my picture,
I think we are supposed to do that.

1239
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,900
(Thora)
Well now, this is interesting.

1240
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,700
(Thora): I thought I was
getting an exclusive on this.

1241
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,100
I would like to know what
the   is going on here.

1242
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,300
Well, like I said, we just saw
 “Lazy Ol' Moon”, and...

1243
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,800
And Hobie and I are
fixing to be friendly.

1244
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,100
WHAT?

1245
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,800
- we are just...
- (Thora): Friends, my foot.

1246
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
what is the matter, Hobie?

1247
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
- I got to skedaddle, so sorry.
- Oh.

1248
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,200
I had to catch one of your pictures
next time, I am looking forward to it.

1249
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,000
Goodbye, Hobie.

1250
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,800
Hey, toss me them keys, pard.
I am taking the car.

1251
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,200
LOCKHEED
INTERNATIONAL AIRCRAFT

1252
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:05,200
Hobie Doyle.
you are a communist too?

1253
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,000
So it is commies?

1254
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,000
You ever been in this place?

1255
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,100
Pretty nice, ha?
it is Burt Gurney's!

1256
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,300
He sings, he dances.
he is got taste.

1257
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,800
You here alone?

1258
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,200
Everyone else went down
to the beach.

1259
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,100
Well, all right, pard.

1260
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,100
let us us head on back to town.
You got Mr. Mannix worried sick.

1261
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,700
Easy.

1262
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,400
Easy.

1263
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,100
Here.

1264
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,600
Take care of him.

1265
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,300
- Tell him.
- Give it to him.

1266
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,400
Comrade!
Comrade!

1267
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,600
We salute you.

1268
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,300
You are going to Moscow
to become Soviet Man.

1269
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,700
and help forge the future.

1270
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:47,500
We stay behind, continuing to serve
in our disguise as capitalist handmaiden.

1271
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,600
But, the money should go to the cause
not to the servant of the cause.

1272
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,000
- Yes!
- that is right.

1273
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,700
We...
Well...

1274
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,400
Our modest contribution
to the Comintern.

1275
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,300
They will be pleased.

1276
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,800
No!
No!

1277
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,100
Eng...!
Engels!

1278
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,800
- Oh.
- Oh...

1279
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,500
Oh, oh, no...

1280
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,300
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

1281
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,200
Hoh.

1282
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,600
Oh, boy, it is late.
I am in the doghouse.

1283
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,600
Better forget about my place.
Drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1284
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,500
Alright then.

1285
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,800
Ha!

1286
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,700
- Whofre you?
- Todd.

1287
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,000
Todd...

1288
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,500
You have a hot breakfast
or a box breakfast?

1289
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,300
I...
I do not know.

1290
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,200
Are you a principal or an extra?

1291
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,700
I think I am a principal.

1292
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,000
Yeah.

1293
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,400
I am thinking, "What the  !"

1294
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,400
I have woken up in strange houses before
but never without a broad next to me.

1295
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,700
- a-ha.
- These guys were pretty interesting, though.

1296
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:51,100
they have actually figured out
the laws that dictate... everything.

1297
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,400
History, sociology, politics, morality.
Everything.

1298
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,100
it is all in a book called "Kapital",
with a K.

1299
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,400
- That right?
- Yeah.

1300
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,100
you are not going to believe this,

1301
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,200
these guys even figured it out
what is going on here at the studio.

1302
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:09,400
Because the studio is nothing more
than an instrument of capitalism.

1303
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,600
Yes, so we blindly follows these laws
like any other institution.

1304
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,400
The laws these guys've figured out.

1305
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,700
The studio makes pictures
to serve the system,

1306
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,600
that is it is function,
that is really what we are all up to, here.

1307
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,900
- Is it?
- Yeah, we are just confirming

1308
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,500
what they call the “status quo.”

1309
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,300
 I mean, we might tell ourselves that
we are “creating” something of artistic value,

1310
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,300
that there is some sort of
spiritual dimension to the picture business,

1311
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,400
but what it is,
is this   cat,

1312
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,300
Nick Schenk, out in New York
 running this factory

1313
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,500
that is serving up these lollypops
to the...

1314
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,400
what did you use to call the
a brand circuses for the...

1315
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,700
What?
Wait...

1316
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,200
Now, you listen to me, buster.

1317
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,000
Nick Schenk and this studio
have been good to you

1318
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,700
and to everyone else
who works here.

1319
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,700
If I ever hear you
bad mouthing Mr. Schenk again

1320
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,100
 it will be the last thing you say
before I have you tossed into jail

1321
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,600
for colluding in
your own abduction.

1322
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,000
Eddie! I would not,
I would never do that.

1323
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,500
Shut up.

1324
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,600
you are going to go out there and
you are going to finish "Hail, Caesar!"

1325
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,700
you are going to give the speech
at the feet of the penitent thief

1326
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,600
and you are going to believe
every word you say.

1327
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,500
you are going to do it because
you are an actor and that is what you do.

1328
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,100
Just like the director
does what he does,

1329
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,300
and the writer and the script girl
and the guy who claps the slate.

1330
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,600
you are going to do it because
the picture has Worth

1331
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,200
and you have Worth if you serve the picture
and you are never going to forget that again.

1332
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,200
Okay, Eddie, okay.

1333
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,900
I will not forget it, Eddie.

1334
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,200
you are   right you will not.

1335
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,900
Not as long as I run this dump.

1336
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,500
Baird.

1337
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,400
Go out there and be a star!

1338
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,300
Mr. Mannix!

1339
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,100
 Since you are going to your car,
I thought you might want to take this.

1340
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,900
- What is it?
- From DeeAnna Moran.

1341
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,200
Thank you, and she does not
need to adopt her baby after all.

1342
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,400
Ha!

1343
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,200
She asked Joe Silverman
out for dinner last night,

1344
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,400
and I guess it went well,
they drove to Palm Springs

1345
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,700
and were married
at three this morning.

1346
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:12,100
Ha.

1347
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,200
Will you be gone long?
Today's call list.

1348
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,100
No, less than an hour,
personal errand.

1349
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,300
- Ah.
- it is a nice arrangement.

1350
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,500
- She charged it to the studio.
- Right.

1351
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,600
- (Thora): Just coming to see you.
- Good morning.

1352
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,100
Sorry about last night, Thora,

1353
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,900
I did not know your
sister would show up.

1354
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,800
Well that is as may be,
but I certainly learned my lesson.

1355
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,700
Whatever you say today,
Eddie Mannix,

1356
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,200
my column tomorrow is about...

1357
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,400
“On Wings as Eagles.”

1358
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,900
- Thora, I would not do that if I were you.
- I am sure you would not.

1359
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,200
No, no, no, you do not understand.
let us sit down.

1360
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,100
I am telling you not to run the column,
Thora, for your own good.

1361
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,800
I can judge my own interest.

1362
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,700
This will be the
story of the year

1363
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,200
And it so happens, the Hearst Syndicate
is looking to pick up a Hollywood column.

1364
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,000
- And you think this will cinch it for you.
- You know it will.

1365
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,000
Baird Whitlock, your biggest star,

1366
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,800
got his first major part
in “On Wings as Eagles”

1367
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,300
by engaging in sodomy

1368
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,100
with the picture's director,
Laurence Laurentz.

1369
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,200
we have all heard the story.

1370
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,200
But here is something you have not heard:

1371
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,200
your source is a communist.

1372
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,800
If you print it it will be dismissed
as a   smear tactic

1373
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,400
and you will be dismissed
as a   stooge.

1374
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,000
Burt Gurney has left the country,
the cell he was part of

1375
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,200
has been smashed
by the police.

1376
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,100
You might have thought he was credible
because he is Mr. Laurentz's current... protege,

1377
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,000
but, you do not want to be seen as
Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

1378
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,600
How did you know
Burt was my source?

1379
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,800
Late last night, I talked to Laurence,
put two and two together.

1380
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,700
Well, no reason to send this
since I ran into you.

1381
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,300
it is by way of apology for
Thessaly homing in last night.

1382
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,300
I do value our friendship, Thora.

1383
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,700
And I am late for something important.

1384
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:14,400
Why on your knees before
this Hebrew, Autolochus?

1385
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,300
I encountered him before, Gracchus,

1386
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,900
beside the well of Jehosaphat.

1387
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,800
And what manner of man.

1388
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,700
He is a priest of the Israelites,
despised even by the other priests.

1389
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:32,000
No.
On yesterday's march,

1390
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,400
punished by the dust of the road,

1391
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,300
I sought to drink first at the well,

1392
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:40,600
before the slaves and my charge
who is thirst was far greater than my own.

1393
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,200
A Roman drinks before a  .

1394
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,600
This man was giving water to all.

1395
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,600
He saw no Roman
and he saw no  .

1396
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,700
He saw only men.

1397
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:53,500
Weak men and gave suckle.

1398
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,600
He saw suffering
which he sought to ease.

1399
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,500
He saw sin
and gave love.

1400
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,900
Love, Autolochus?

1401
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,100
He saw my own sin, Gracchus,
and greed.

1402
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,400
But in his eyes,
I saw no shadow of reproach.

1403
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,600
I saw only light.

1404
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,000
The light of  .

1405
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:19,000
You mean, of the gods.

1406
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,400
I do not, friend Gracchus.

1407
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,200
This Hebrew is a son
of the one  ,

1408
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,300
the   of this far-fiung tribe.

1409
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,600
Why should not Gothes anointed
appear here,

1410
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,500
among these strange people
to shoulder their sins.

1411
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,700
Here, Gracchus.

1412
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,900
In this, sun-drenched land.

1413
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,000
Why should he not take
this form.

1414
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,200
The form of an ordinary man.

1415
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,400
A man bringing us
not the old truths.

1416
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
but a new one.

1417
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,300
A new truth.

1418
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:58,100
A truth beyond
the truth that we can see.

1419
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,800
A truth beyond this world.

1420
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:05,600
A truth told not in words
but in light.

1421
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,500
A truth that we could see
if we have but...

1422
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,100
if we have but...

1423
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,900
Cut.
Cut!

1424
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,500
Faith.
Have but faith.

1425
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,000
Faith.

1426
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,700
- Faith! Faith!     it!
- Roll it again.

1427
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,400
- Is it the...
- They changed it.

1428
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,700
You got most of it, man.
you are alright.

1429
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,500
Alright, hang on.

1430
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,200
Could I get a pat down,
I am sweating like a pig in this thing.

1431
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,300
Ah, son of a  !

1432
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,900
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

1433
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,000
How long since your last confession,
my son?

1434
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:49,800
it is been...
27 hours.

1435
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,200
it is really too often, my son.

1436
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,400
- you are not that bad
- I do not know, father.

1437
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:00,300
I snuck a cigarette or two.

1438
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,000
I did not make it home
in time for dinner.

1439
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,800
And I...

1440
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,100
I struck a movie star in anger.

1441
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,800
All right.
Five Hail Marys.

1442
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,900
Okay.

1443
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,100
Okay.

1444
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,800
Father.

1445
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,600
Yes, my son?

1446
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,300
May I ask you something, father.

1447
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,500
Of course, my son.

1448
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,900
If there is something that is easy.

1449
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,400
Is that...
wrong?

1450
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,000
- Easy?
- a... easy to do.

1451
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:49,000
Easy to...

1452
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,500
Like an easy job.

1453
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,700
No, it is not a bad job,
it is not bad.

1454
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,400
But...
then...

1455
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,300
there is this other job.

1456
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,800
that is...
it is not so easy.

1457
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:04,500
In fact, it is hard.
it is...

1458
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,500
it is so hard, Father, sometimes
I do not know if I can keep doing it.

1459
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,600
But, it...
it...

1460
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But it seems right.

1461
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,500
I do not know how to explain.

1462
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:24,100
  wants us to do what is right.

1463
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,900
Yeah.

1464
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,900
Yeah, course He does.

1465
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
The inner voice that tells you
what is right,

1466
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:38,900
it comes from  , my son.

1467
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,500
- Yeah, got it.
- that is His way of saying that...

1468
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,100
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Thanks.

1469
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:44,600
Still raining in Gallup, New Mexico

1470
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,600
and the “Tucumcari” crew has shot all
the plates we need for “Came the Rain.”

1471
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,300
Well, just shoot the showdown
in the weather and we will retitle it.

1472
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,900
"Tucumcari tempest".
“Desert Squall”. “Hold Back the Storm”.

1473
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,600
The stories begin.
The stories end.

1474
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
I do not know,
bounce it off the writers.

1475
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,200
So, it is be.

1476
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,300
here is today's call list.

1477
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,700
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy at
the Lockheed Corporation.

1478
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,200
Long call, short?

1479
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,500
“Thanks but no thanks”,
how long was that?

1480
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,800
- But the story of Eddie Mannix...
- Who do we call first?

1481
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,200
... will never end.

1482
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,100
New York first.
Time to check in with Mr. Schenk.

1483
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:18,600
For his is a tale written
in light everlasting.

1484
