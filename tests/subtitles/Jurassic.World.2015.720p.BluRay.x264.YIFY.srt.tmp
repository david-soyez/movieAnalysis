1
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,726
Boys, let us do this!

2
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,723
Gray?

3
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,888
Honey, what are you doing?

4
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,565
What is this?
Here. let us go.

5
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,643
Come on, honey.
Your flightos in two hours.

6
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,083
Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

7
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,851
How many minutes to get
your little   in the van?

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,086
How many of those?

9
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,088
Feed the monster under your bed?
Yes.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,002
Call me every day,

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,845
and text me pics,
so I do not forget what you look like.

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
I am only going to be gone a week.

13
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,247
Zach.

14
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,766
you are not going off to war here.
Please.

15
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,166
Come on.

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,084
I will see you later.
I love you.

17
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,241
<i>Vámonos.</i>

18
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,283
Bye, okay?
Bye.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,528
Are you in, buddy?

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,611
I know it hurts, sweetheart.

21
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,085
Are you going to be okay?

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,121
Everything right on there?

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,445
I am so jealous.

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,251
you are going to have so much fun.
I love you.

25
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,924
I love you, too.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,569
Okay, great.

27
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,564
All right, let us give these
to your brother, okay?

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,447
You hold these, please.
Can you hold these? Zach.

29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,170
Honey, I need you to take care of these.

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,088
Yeah.

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,280
Hey.
All right.

32
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,481
Listen to your mother.

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,080
Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone.

34
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,890
I am serious.
it is the green button.

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,962
When you see my name, push it, okay?

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,166
And remember,

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,045
something chases you, run.

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,201
Come on.

39
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,084
All right. you are funny.
Okay, let us go. Come on.

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,730
Bye, guys.
Bye.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,564
I miss you already.
Yeah.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,371
So much for our last family breakfast.

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,681
Why do you have to say things like that?

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,089
Did you call your sister?

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,162
Straight to voice-mail.

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,489
it will be fine.
She handles 20,000 people a day, right?

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,489
She can handle two more.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>How big is the island?</i>

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,769
Big.

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,365
But how many pounds?

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,805
That does not make sense.

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,965
When they first opened,
they had eight species.

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,970
Now they have 14 herbivores
and six carnivores.

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,804
that is 50 tons of food a week.

55
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,007
<i>Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World.</i>

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,010
<i>We hope you have a safe
and enjoyable stay with us.</i>

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,889
where is Aunt Claire?

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,327
<i>Okay.
Those of you in the front of the train.</i>

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,607
<i>Should be able to see our main gates.</i>

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,845
<i>Please obey all park rules.</i>

61
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,720
<i>Proper attire, including shoes and shirts,
must be worn at all times.</i>

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1:00.
Can he slow down?

63
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,727
Nope.

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,450
Come on!

65
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,482
Your auntos got you VIP access,

66
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,961
so you can get in all the rides
without waiting in line.

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,167
let us go.

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,241
Dude, she said we had to wait.

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,243
I do not want to wait anymore.

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,688
Hal Osterly, vice presidid not.
Jim Drucker, bad hair.

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,208
Erica Brand, deserves better.

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,005
Hal, Jim, Erica.
Hal, Jim, Erica.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,560
And I am Claire.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,250
Three minutes late.

75
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,167
Welcome to Jurassic World.

76
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,000
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb,

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,321
operating costs are higher than ever.

78
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,121
Our shareholders have been patient,
but let us be honest,

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,283
no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore.

80
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,489
Twenty years ago, de-extinction
was right up there with magic.

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,289
These days, kids look at a <i>Stegosaurus</i>

82
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,727
like an elephant from the city zoo.

83
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,167
That does not mean
asset development is falling behind.

84
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,611
Our DNA excavators
discover new species every year.

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,248
But consumers want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,365
The good news?

87
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,529
Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,564
we have learned more from
genetics in the past decade

89
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,642
than a century of digging up bones.

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,601
So,

91
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,570
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction,

92
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,881
what do you have in mind?

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,170
We want to be thrilled.

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,730
do not we all?

95
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,330
The <i>Indominus Rex.</i>

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,165
Our first genetically modified hybrid.

97
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,642
How did you get two different
kinds of dinosaurs to, you know...

98
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,167
<i>Indominus</i> was not bred.
She was designed.

99
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,487
She will be 50 feet long when fully grown.

100
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,250
Bigger than the T. Rex.

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,081
Every time we have unveiled a new asset,
attendance has spiked.

102
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Global news coverage, celebrity visitors.

103
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,451
Eyes of the world.

104
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,164
When will she be ready?

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,208
She already is.

106
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,366
Come on!

107
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,561
Relax.

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,167
Come on.

109
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,203
Dude, chill.

110
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,849
<i>Welcome to the Innovation Center,</i>

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,406
<i>where technology meets prehistory.</i>

112
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,086
<i>The Triceratops can go
horn-to-tooth with the apex predators.</i>

113
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,443
<i>Literally meaning
"three-horned face" in Greek,</i>

114
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,644
<i>Triceratops is half as tall as T. Rex</i>

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,651
<i>as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT.</i>

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,926
<i>Turn its head back

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,322
<i>to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail.</i>

118
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,681
Cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine.

119
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,364
The same four things
in everything that ever lived.

120
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,050
Hey, do not wander off, all right?

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,202
Momys not paying me for babysitting.

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,801
Gray, is that you?

123
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,881
Aunt Claire!

124
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,241
Okay, yeah. No, I am going to have to go.
My nephews are here.

125
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,640
Hi.

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,487
My gosh, you are so sweet.

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,727
Zach.

128
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,081
Last time I saw you, you were like...

129
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,366
That must have been what?

130
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,602
Three, four years ago?
Seven.

131
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,569
Seven years, but, you know, close.

132
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,327
So, I see you already got your wristbands.

133
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,886
And this is for food.

134
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,406
And Zara here
is going to take great care of you

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,204
until I am done working tonight, okay?

136
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,691
you are not coming with us?

137
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,882
I really wish that I could,

138
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,964
but tomorrow I can take you
into the control room,

139
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,088
show you behind the scenes and all of that.

140
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,851
that is going to be cool, right?

141
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,891
Okay, so I will see you tonight at 6:00.

142
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,240
No, do not forget you have the...

143
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,408
Right, of course.
I will see you tonight at 8:00.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,202
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?

145
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,731
Okay, so, have fun,

146
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,411
and take very good care of them, okay?

147
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,528
Yeah.
No, I am here.

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,520
<i>it is those two juvenile Triceratops.

22,216.

155
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,001
Any incidents?
Yes.

156
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,051
Six kids in the Lost and Found,
28 down with heatstroke...

157
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,361
Where did you get that?

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,887
This? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it is pretty amazing.

159
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,282
I got it for $150,
but the mint condition one goes for $300...

160
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,522
did not occur to you maybe
that is in poor taste?

161
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,250
The shirt?
Yeah, no, it did.

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,008
I understand people died. It was
terrible, but that first park was legit.

163
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,009
I have a lot of respect for it.

164
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,764
They did not need these genetic hybrids.

165
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,729
They just needed dinosaurs, real dinosaurs.

166
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,922
Okay, please do not wear it again.
that is kind of enough.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,126
Yeah, I was not going to.

168
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you close the deal?
Looks like it.

169
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,965
Verizon Wireless presents
the <i>Indominus Rex.</i>

170
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,485
That is so terrible.

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,724
Why not just go the distance, Claire,

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,531
and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs?

173
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,846
they have got all the ballparks.

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,327
Why stop there?
Why are the West Plains closed?

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,767
Another Pachy roaming outside his zone.

176
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,922
But he is fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

177
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,804
Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don.

178
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,962
Security said
the invisible fences were a no-fail.

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,644
That is the second time this month.

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,042
Well, the Pachys short out
their implants when they   heads.

181
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,208
How much longer
until they get it out of there?

182
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,567
He just got five milligrams of carfentanil.

183
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,043
Yes, he is very  .
So why do not we show a little sympathy?

184
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,403
I mean, you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

185
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,244
Clean up your workspace.
it is chaotic.

186
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,483
I like to think of it as a living system.

187
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,009
Just enough stability
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

188
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,366
<i>Inbound chopper, Jurassic 1.
Eto, 5 minutes.</i>

189
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,881
Claire.

190
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,803
Mr. Masrani.
You are flying.

191
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,405
I got my license.

192
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,727
Two more.
Well, two more days.

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,926
Okay.

194
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,042
So, how is my park doing?
Great.

195
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,128
we are up 2.5% over last year.

196
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,288
A bit lower than our initial projection.

197
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,811
No, no, no, how is it doing?

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,043
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

199
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,681
Well, guest
satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.

200
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,322
We do not have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,006
Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes.

202
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
Right?

203
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,811
Of course.

204
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,925
Okay.
Now show me my new dinosaur.

205
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,404
Got it.

206
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,410
Got it.

207
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,568
My!

208
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,046
You look tense, Claire.

209
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,608
Maybe you should just
focus on the controls.

210
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,967
The key to a happy life is to accept

211
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,725
you are never actually in control.

212
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,887
Bird!

213
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,442
You should spend a day at the beach.
Get some sun.

214
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,045
Right, so...

215
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,806
Marketing thought
we could offset some of the costs by...

216
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,968
Enough about cost.

217
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,168
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,

218
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,408
and not once did he mention profits.

219
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,608
"Spare no expense," he used to say.

220
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,681
I appreciate that,

221
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,207
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires...

222
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,322
do not forget why we built this place,
Claire.

223
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,722
Jurassic World exists to
remind us how very small we are.

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,844
How new.
You cannot put a price on that.

225
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,328
Now, please, we are flying.

226
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,203
Breathe.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,489
Is he okay?
Are you okay?

228
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,927
he is just being dramatic.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,809
Are you still building?

230
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,363
We planned to open in May,

231
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,206
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,362
it is bigger than expected.

233
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,925
it is a good sign.

234
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,684
We hit a few speed bumps early on.

235
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,889
It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

236
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,889
One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.

237
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,885
The others threatened to quit if
I could not guarantee their safety.

238
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,209
She is intelligent then?

239
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,409
For a dinosaur.

240
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,568
And that?

241
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,804
It tried to break the glass.

242
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,928
I like her spirit.

243
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,841
it is white.
You never told me it was white.

244
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,442
Think it will scare the kids?

245
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,204
The kids?

246
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,368
This will give the parents nightmares.

247
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,484
Is that good?

248
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,607
it is fantastic.

249
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,404
Can she see us?

250
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,208
They say it can sense thermal radiation.

251
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,611
Like snakes.

252
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,688
I thought there were two of them.

253
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,247
There was a sibling
in case this one did not survive infancy.

254
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,322
where is the sibling?

255
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,487
She ate it.

256
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,326
So, the paddock is quite safe, then?

257
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,002
We have the best
structural engineers in the world.

258
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah, so did Hammond.

259
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,327
there is an American Navy man here.

260
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,370
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

261
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,130
Owen Grady.

262
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,401
I know who he is.

263
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,443
His animals often try to escape.

264
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,444
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

265
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,249
He only thinks he is smarter.

266
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,689
I want you to bring him in.

267
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,765
Let him inspect the paddock.

268
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,326
Maybe he sees something we cannot.

269
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,210
Hold!

270
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,121
Hey!

271
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,881
Okay!

272
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,881
Eyes on me.

273
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,530
Blue?

274
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,284
Blue!

275
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,166
Watch it.

276
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,521
Charlie.
Hey!

277
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,361
do not give me that  !

278
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,566
Delto!

279
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,085
Lock it up!

280
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,683
Good!

281
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,928
And we are moving!

282
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,971
Hold!

283
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,082
that is good.
That is   good.

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,967
Very good!

285
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,447
See, Charlie, that is what you get!

286
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,242
Echo, there you go!
Delto!

287
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,081
Blue?

288
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,602
This one's for you.

289
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,606
Hold!

290
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,567
Eyes up!

291
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,881
Go.

292
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,521
You finally did it, man.

293
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,641
Owen.

294
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,723
I was starting to think
I hired the wrong guys,

295
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,802
but,  , you got them
eating out of your palm.

296
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,080
You came on a good day.
it is not usually a happy ending.

297
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,884
Is that why you are not sending in
your reports?

298
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,371
we have been busy.

299
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,046
Not too busy to cash your paychecks.

300
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,165
What do you need, buddy?

301
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,921
A field test.

302
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,407
Hey. I have just seen
they can respond to commands.

303
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,926
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,365
These are wild animals, Hoskins.

305
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,283
Trust me, you do not want them in the field.

306
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,569
I just saw a bond.
A real bond.

307
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,768
Between man and beast.

308
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,841
you are in my way.

309
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,285
Come on.
we are the same.

310
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,850
we are dogs of war.

311
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,009
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

312
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,082
Some people think that
robots are the future.

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,731
Look, nature gave us the most effective

314
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,371
killing machines 75 million years ago.

315
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,926
And now we know they can take orders.

316
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,685
We finally make progress
and that is the first thing he says?

317
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,364
Make a weapon?

318
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,811
 .

319
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,245
Come on, gents.

320
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,362
it is grown-up time.

321
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,161
Drones cannot search tunnels and caves.
And they are hackable.

322
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,605
The minute a real war breaks out,

323
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,967
all that fancy tech is going to go dark.

324
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,044
But that tech's not going to eat them
if they forget to feed it.

325
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,529
Look at these creatures.

326
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,444
they have got millions
of years of instinct in their cells,

327
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
instinct that we can program.

328
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,167
Their loyalty can not be bought.

329
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,371
These guys are going to run

330
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,408
straight into the enemy's
teeth and eat them,

331
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,483
belt buckle and all.

332
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,961
What if they decide
they want to be in control?

333
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,211
Well, then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

334
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,567
Promote only loyal bloodlines.

335
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,087
What?
what is so funny?

336
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,447
I do not know.
You come here

337
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,090
and you do not learn
anything about these animals

338
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,844
except what you want to know.

339
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,686
You made them,
and now you think you own them.

340
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,490
We do own them.

341
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,402
Extinct animals have no rights.

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,331
they are not extinct anymore, Hoskins.

343
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,688
Exactly.
we are sitting on a goldmine.

344
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,128
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

345
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,050
He just wants to teach people
some humility. He does not make weapons.

346
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,851
You think that the eighth
richest man in the world

347
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,448
is only into oil, telecom,
and family fun parks?

348
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,363
he is so diversified,
he does not even know what he owns.

349
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,647
How long has InGen
been practicing this pitch?

350
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,765
Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.

351
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,680
These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground.

352
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,762
How many lives would that save?

353
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,566
War is part of nature.

354
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,244
Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle

355
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,850
is trying to   the other.

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,049
Mother Nature's way
of testing her creations.

357
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,566
Refining the pecking order.

358
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,769
War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.

359
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,041
Without that,

360
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,050
we end up with places like this,
charge seven bucks a sort of.

361
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,209
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

362
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,885
This is going to happen.
With or without you boys.

363
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,451
Progress always wins, man.

364
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,402
Maybe progress should lose for once.

365
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,845
Pig loose!

366
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,163
Pig loose!

367
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,721
Owen, no!

368
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,324
No, hold your fire!

369
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,207
Hold your fire.
Do not fire.

370
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,285
Put 12 amps in these animals,
they are never going to trust me again.

371
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,126
Blue, stand down.

372
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,087
Stand down.

373
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,686
Hey!
What did I just say?

374
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,161
Delto, I see you.
Back up!

375
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
Okay.

376
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,926
Good.

377
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,121
Good.

378
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,721
Charlie?

379
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,521
Stay right there.

380
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,490
Good.

381
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,321
Close the gate.

382
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,530
Are you crazy?

383
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,562
Just trust me.

384
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,721
Close the gate!

385
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,566
I am okay.

386
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,806
Yeah.

387
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,726
you are the new guy, right?

388
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,401
Yeah.

389
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,921
You ever wonder why
there was a job opening?

390
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,085
Hey.

391
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,766
do not ever turn your back to the cage.

392
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,848
Lift me up.
I cannot see!

393
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,168
I am not Dad.
And you are not five.

394
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,526
I can still ride the <i>Triceratops</i>.
I am 47-and-a-half inches.

395
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,920
This place is for little kids.

396
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Yeah, I know.

397
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,087
want to go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?
Nope.

398
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,288
Cover up your dork pouch.

399
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,005
Because it is my wedding.

400
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,361
No, Alec's not having a bachelor party.

401
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,130
Because all his friends are animals.

402
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,361
Scatter.

403
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,687
What?
Go. Run. Go!

404
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,961
Yuck!

405
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,162
<i>The next T. Rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes.</i>

406
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,169
T. Rex! Come on, man!
Come on! Okay.

407
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,566
let us go!

408
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,523
<i>Parents be aware, this show may be</i>

409
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,648
<i>disturbing for smaller children.</i>

410
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,800
Hey, Mom.

411
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,963
You were supposed to call me
when you landed.

412
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,166
Are you having fun?

413
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,124
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

414
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,605
Aunt Claire gave us passes,
so we do not have to wait in line.

415
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,165
Wait, she is not with you?

416
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,401
Hey, Karen!

417
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,523
<i>Hi, Claire.
how is it going?</i>

418
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,162
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.

419
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,891
<i>Everyone's...
Yeah, everyone's good.</i>

420
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,450
Really?
Because I just hung up with Zach,

421
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,329
and he said that you
were not even with them.

422
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,930
Yeah, look. Today turned
out to be a really bad day for me.

423
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,521
<i>they are in great hands.
they are with my assistant.</i>

424
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,690
<i>She is British, so they invented nannies.</i>

425
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Wait, are you crying?

426
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,884
This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire.

427
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,560
You have not seen the boys in forever.

428
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,762
And I know how Zach will treat Gray
if they are by themselves.

429
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,928
And he can just be so mean.

430
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,929
Okay, I am sorry.

431
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,647
<i>Tomorrow, I am going to spend
the entire day with them.</i>

432
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
I am going to take off work,
and I will not leave their side.

433
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,481
I promise.

434
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,042
Well, a promise tomorrow
is worth a lot less than trying today.

435
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,970
you are using Momys lines now?

436
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,487
My  .
I am using Momys lines.

437
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,449
I am sorry, but you know,
I have to tell you, they work.

438
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,290
<i>you will see when you have kids.</i>

439
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,441
Yeah, "if."

440
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,008
"When." it is worth it.

441
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,810
Bye, Mom.

442
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,721
Bye.

443
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,770
What do they want now?

444
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,967
Mr. Grady?

445
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,807
I need you to come
take a look at something.

446
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,283
Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?

447
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,811
Owen.

448
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,766
If you are not too busy.

449
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,966
I am pretty busy.

450
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,610
We have an attraction.

451
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,603
that is not what you said
the last time I saw you.

452
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,921
I am talking about the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.

453
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,525
Owen.

454
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,722
A new species we have made.

455
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,844
You just went and made a new dinosaur?

456
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,003
Yeah, it is kind of what we do here.

457
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,960
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

458
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,125
Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you.

459
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,444
You want to consult here or in my bungalow?

460
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,970
that is not funny.

461
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,045
A little funny.

462
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,010
we would like you to evaluate the
paddock for vulnerabilities.

463
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,730
Why me?

464
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,521
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you are able to control the Raptors...

465
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,966
it is all about control with you.

466
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,249
I do not control the Raptors.
it is a relationship.

467
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,567
it is based on mutual respect.

468
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,762
that is why you and I
never had a second date.

469
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,691
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.

470
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,728
Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?

471
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,410
I am an organized person.

472
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,046
What kind of a diet does not allow tequila?

473
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,804
All of them, actually.

474
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,289
And what kind of a man shows
up to a date in board shorts?

475
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,442
it is Central America.
it is hot. Okay. Okay.

476
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,450
Can we just focus on the asset, please?

477
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,965
The asset?

478
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,850
Look, I get it.
you are in charge out here.

479
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
You have got to make a lot of tough decisions.

480
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,605
it is probably easier
to pretend these animals

481
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,081
are just numbers on a spreadsheet.

482
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,845
But they are not.
they are alive.

483
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,602
I am fully aware they are alive.

484
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,405
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they do not know that.

485
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,722
they are thinking, "I have got to eat."

486
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,284
"I have got to hunt.
I have got to..."

487
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,847
You can relate to
at least one of those things.

488
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,126
Right?

489
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,921
I will be in the car.

490
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,206
You might want to change your shirt.

491
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,489
they are very sensitive to smell.

492
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,247
<i>The Mosasaurus</i>

493
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,966
<i>was thought to have
hunted near the surface of the water</i>

494
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,323
<i>where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into,</i>

495
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,970
<i>including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs.</i>

496
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,848
<i>Okay, folks, let us see if she is still
hungry after already eating today.</i>

497
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,565
<i>She is a little shy, so be nice and
give her a hand when she comes out.</i>

498
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,290
Zach, Zach!

499
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
<i>The Mosasaurus!</i>

500
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,046
My  !
That was awesome!

501
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

502
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,809
<i>we are going to give you
an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.</i>

503
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,690
It had 88 teeth!

504
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,801
You want to see something else cool?
Yeah!

505
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,209
we have been pre-booking tickets for months.

506
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,131
The park needs a new
attraction every few years

507
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,487
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

508
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,483
Kind of like the space program.

509
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,121
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the Wow factor.

510
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,288
they are dinosaurs - Wow enough.

511
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,767
Not according to our focus groups.

512
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,081
The <i>Indominus Rex</i> makes us relevant again.

513
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,202
The <i>Indominus Rex?</i>

514
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,329
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

515
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,771
You should hear a four-year-old

516
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,962
try to say <i>"Archaeornithomimus."</i>

517
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,321
You should hear you try to say it.

518
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,484
So what is this thing made of?

519
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,967
The base genome is a T. Rex.
The rest is classified.

520
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,771
You made a new dinosaur,
but you do not even know what it is?

521
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,808
The lab delivers us finished assets,

522
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,245
and we show them to the public.

523
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,323
Can we drop a steer, please?

524
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,329
How long has the animal been in here?

525
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,411
All its life.

526
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,767
Never seen anything outside of these walls?

527
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,166
We cannot exactly walk it.

528
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,805
And you feed it with that?

529
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,804
Is there a problem?

530
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,283
Animals raised in isolation are not
always the most functional.

531
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,890
Your Raptors are born in captivity.

532
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,442
With siblings.
They learn social skills.

533
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
And I imprint on them when they are born.

534
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,606
there is trust.

535
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,810
The only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane.

536
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,320
At least she knows that means food.

537
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,330
So, she needs a friend.

538
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,808
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

539
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,724
Probably not a good idea.

540
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,240
Where is it?

541
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,481
Is it in the basement?

542
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,008
Or downstairs?
Maybe it is in the rec room.

543
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,322
It was just here.
We were just here.

544
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,003
 .

545
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,882
That does not make any sense.

546
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,808
These doors have not been opened in weeks.

547
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,448
Were those claw marks always there?

548
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,841
Do you think it..?

549
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,569
Oh  .

550
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,370
She has an implant in her back.

551
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,125
I can track it from the control room.

552
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,564
We have an asset out of containment.

553
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,326
Put ACU on alert.
This is not a drill.

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,131
Even though I did not meet him
until I was 13,

555
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,884
I definitely consider Carl to be

556
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,485
more of a dad than my real dad.

557
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,329
Yeah, hello?
<i>Lowery.</i>

558
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,164
Get me coordinates on the <i>Indominus.</i>

559
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,607
Okay, yeah.

560
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,246
I am doing it right now.

561
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
That wall is 40 feet high.

562
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,325
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

563
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,363
It depends.

564
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,726
On what?

565
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,244
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

566
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,082
Wait, what the  ?

567
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,930
it is in the cage.

568
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,282
No, that is impossible.
I was just there.

569
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,249
Claire, I am telling you, she is in the cage.

570
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,403
Wait a sec.

571
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,891
There are people in there.

572
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,803
Get them out of there now.

573
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,881
Now!

574
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,089
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.

575
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,720
<i>Paddock 11.</i>

576
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,169
<i>Paddock 11, do you copy?</i>

577
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,681
Yeah, what is the problem?

578
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,444
it is in the cage!
it is in there with you!

579
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Go!

580
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,171
Close the door.

581
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,402
We cannot lock him in there with that thing.
Close it now!

582
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,561
<i>Somebody talk to me!</i>

583
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,761
What is happening?

584
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,168
 !

585
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,482
Everyone remain calm.

586
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,407
The implant will shock it
if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.

587
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,090
Okay.
it is moving really fast.

588
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,003
This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert.

589
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,128
Hang up that   phone, please.

590
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,441
Sorry, I am getting new information.
Everything's fine.

591
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Let Asset Containment capture it quietly.

592
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,442
The very existence of this park is
predicated on our ability

593
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,329
to handle incidents like this.

594
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,249
It was an eventuality, okay?

595
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,084
You should put that in the brochure.

596
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,607
"Eventually, one of these
things will eat somebody."

597
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,048
That paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction.

598
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,641
ACU can handle this.
No one else is going to get...

599
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,205
Eaten?

600
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,331
<i>To all units.
This is a non-lethal operation. Understood?</i>

601
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,850
How fast can they run?

602
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,681
Forty.

603
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,569
Fifty when they are hungry.

604
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,080
You ever open them up,
see what they can do?

605
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,170
No.

606
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,884
 !

607
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
That got me.
It got me.

608
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,086
What do you think?
Want to take one home?

609
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,486
Hey, do not joke.

610
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,485
When I was your age,

611
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,882
I rescued a wolf pup.

612
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,880
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.

613
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,723
It used to sleep by my bed.

614
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,086
Watch over me.

615
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,962
My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.

616
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,525
It took a chunk out of her arm.

617
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,127
Did you put him down?

618
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,965
 , no.

619
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,811
We had an unshakeable bond, you know?

620
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,843
Just like you and...

621
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,606
what is his name?

622
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
Delto.
And she is a girl.

623
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,041
Can I...

624
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,921
Code 19!

625
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,361
that is the new one!

626
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,566
They said we lost two guys!

627
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,926
what is a Code 19?

628
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,890
that is <i>Indominus!</i>
Asset out of containment.

629
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,088
These people, they never learn.

630
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,966
they are going to learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now.

631
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,242
Hey. Yeah, it is me.
We might have an opportunity here.

632
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,404
You guys been here before?

633
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,086
If Mom and Dad get divorced,

634
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,162
will one of us be with Mom
and the other with Dad?

635
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,687
What?
Why would you say that?

636
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,881
Because they are.

637
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,930
No, they are not getting...
they are not getting divorced.

638
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,840
Look. You have not been around long enough.
they have always been that way.

639
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,164
They get mail from two different lawyers.

640
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,009
That does not mean anything.

641
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,923
I googled.
they are divorce lawyers.

642
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,881
All right, whatever.

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,446
You know what?
It does not matter, okay?

644
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,851
I am going to be gone in two years anyway.

645
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,884
I mean, all my friends' parents
are divorced.

646
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,770
Hey, knock it off.

647
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,086
you are going to cry?

648
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,882
Look.
you are going to get two of everything, right?

649
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,890
you are going to get two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings, two...

650
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,883
I do not want two of everything.

651
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,449
Yeah, well, it is not up to you.

652
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,368
All right?
there is a point you have to grow up.

653
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,244
I need to see a badge.
Sir, I need to see a badge.

654
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,930
What the   happened out there?
Sir.

655
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,486
There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock.

656
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,568
She did not just disappear!

657
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,566
It must have been
some kind of a technical malfunction.

658
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,170
Were you not watching?

659
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,004
She marked up that wall as a distraction.

660
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,650
She wanted us to think she escaped!

661
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,609
Hold on.
We are talking about an animal here.

662
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,848
A highly intelligent animal.

663
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,570
400 meters to the beacon.

664
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,127
you are going after her with non-lethals.

665
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,886
We have $26 million invested in that asset.
We cannot just   it.

666
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,724
Those men are going to die.

667
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,966
300 meters to the beacon.

668
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,281
You need to call this mission off
right now.

669
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,242
they are right on top of it.

670
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,446
Call it off right now.

671
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,563
You are not in control here!

672
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,130
Bloothes not clotted yet.

673
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,850
<i>it is close.</i>

674
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,205
What is that?

675
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,331
that is her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.

676
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,323
How would it know to do that?

677
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,848
She remembered where they put it in.

678
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,645
It can camouflage!

679
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,885
Evacuate the island.

680
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,044
we would never reopen.

681
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,603
You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity.

682
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,411
She is seeing all of
this for the first time.

683
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,051
She does not even know what she is.

684
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,851
She will   everything that moves.

685
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,810
Do you think the animal
is contemplating its own existence?

686
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,484
She is learning where
she fits in the food chain,

687
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,728
and I am not sure
you want her to figure that out.

688
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,207
Now, Asset Containment
can use live ammunition

689
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,964
in an emergency situation.

690
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,929
You have an M134 in your armory.

691
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,923
Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!

692
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,206
We have families here.

693
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,640
I am not going to turn this place
into some kind of a war zone.

694
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,886
You already have.

695
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,123
Mr. Grady, if you are not going to help,
there is no reason for you to be in here.

696
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,402
I would have a word
with your people in the lab.

697
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,201
That thing out there, that is no dinosaur.

698
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,527
Okay.

699
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,523
I am going to close everything
north of the resort.

700
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,042
This is a Phase One, real world.
Bring everyone in.

701
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,003
This is a Phase One, real world.

702
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,531
I repeat, this is a Phase One.

703
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,125
Bring everyone back in.

704
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,126
Did you know

705
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,726
the soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur's blood

706
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,690
generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive.

707
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,531
So, the proteins and the cell
membranes get all mixed up,

708
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,251
and act as a natural preservative.

709
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,528
DNA can survive for millennia that way.

710
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,400
See, now, even if the amber mines dry up,
they will still have bones...

711
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,084
Shut up.

712
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,286
What do you think's going to happen
from you just staring at them?

713
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,360
Thanks, man.

714
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,566
you are welcome.

715
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,046
Enjoy the ride.

716
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,522
<i>Pregnant women
and those who suffer from motion sickness</i>

717
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,887
<i>should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride.</i>

718
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,050
Enjoy the ride.

719
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,047
Hello?

720
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,729
Seriously?

721
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,765
Sorry, folks.
The ride is closed.

722
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,209
Everyone needs to proceed to
the monorail and exit towards the...

723
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,844
Come on, guys, I just work here.

724
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,409
<i>Due to technical difficulties,
all our exhibits are now closed.</i>

725
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,170
You know that I am not at liberty

726
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,164
to reveal the assetos genetic makeup.

727
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,811
Modified animals are
known to be unpredictable.

728
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,284
it is killed people, Henry.

729
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,926
that is unfortunate.

730
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,650
What purpose could we
have for a dinosaur that can camouflage?

731
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,851
Cuttlefish genes were added

732
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,242
to help her withstand
an accelerated growth rate.

733
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,440
Cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow
the skin to change color.

734
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,170
It hid from thermal technology.

735
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,561
Really?

736
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,324
How is that possible?

737
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,683
Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output.

738
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,242
We used strands from their DNA to
adapt her to a tropical climate.

739
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,283
But I never imagined...

740
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,560
Who authorized you to do this?

741
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,881
You did.

742
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,291
"Bigger."

743
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,283
"Scarier."

744
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,610
"Cooler" I believe is the word that
you used in your memo.

745
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,728
You can not have an animal
with exaggerated predator features

746
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,127
without the corresponding
behavioral traits.

747
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,402
What you are doing here...

748
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,208
What you have done...

749
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,605
The Board will shut down this park,

750
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,251
seize your work, everything you have built.

751
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,681
And Hammond will not be there
to protect you this time.

752
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,088
All of this exists because of me.

753
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,408
If I do not innovate, somebody else will.

754
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,847
You are to cease all activities here
immediately.

755
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,082
You are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science.

756
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,882
But we are doing
what we have done from the beginning.

757
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,566
Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.

758
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,645
We have always filled gaps in the
genome with the DNA of other animals.

759
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,286
And, if their genetic code was pure,

760
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,964
many of them would look quite different.

761
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,885
But you did not ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.

762
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,080
I never asked for a monster!

763
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,565
"Monster" is a relative term.

764
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,768
To a canary, a cat is a monster.

765
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,561
we are just used to being the cat.

766
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,605
<i>Hey, there.
I am Jimmy Fallon.</i>

767
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,330
<i>Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,</i>

768
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,971
<i>an amazing machine
made possible by science.</i>

769
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,570
<i>Your safety is our main concern.</i>

770
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,683
<i>Which is why you are behind
our invisible barrier system,</i>

771
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,604
<i>which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom.</i>

772
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,289
<i>One drop of this can paralyze you,
so watch out.</i>

773
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,971
<i>Is this real?
It is?</i>

774
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,091
<i>And for added protection,</i>

775
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,164
<i>each vehicle is surrounded by
aluminum oxynitride glass.</i>

776
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,244
<i>So tough, it can stop a .50-caliber bullet.</i>

777
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,809
<i>The Gyroscopic technology
will keep you upright at all times...</i>

778
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,287
Where are they?
<i>So you have got nothing to worry about.</i>

779
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,686
Man.

780
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,326
<i>Due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed.</i>

781
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,245
<i>Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort.</i>

782
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,251
Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes.

783
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,684
But they said it was closed.

784
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,888
Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands,
right?

785
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,128
we are VIP, dude.

786
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,120
Come on.
it will be fun.

787
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,648
<i>Hello?</i>
Zara.

788
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,200
I need you to bring the boys
back to the hotel right away.

789
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,123
<i>I do not know...
I have been looking everywhere for them.</i>

790
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,163
<i>it is just been quite a while.</i>
Slow down. I cannot hear you.

791
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,730
<i>Zach and Gray, they have run off.</i>

792
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,046
They what?

793
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,565
Hey, Claire.

794
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,610
Zach, thank  .
Is Gray with you?

795
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,968
I cannot really hear you.
we are in the hamster ball.

796
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,889
Okay.
Zach, listen to me.

797
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,849
<i>I need you to...</i>

798
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,201
Hello?

799
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,606
Zach?

800
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,160
Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?

801
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,685
No, they are all accounted for.
it is my job.

802
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,441
What?
there is one in the field.

803
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,204
Send a team of rangers, bring them in.

804
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,203
Security, we need a search
and rescue in the Valley.

805
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,250
<i>it is going to be a while.
we have got our hands full out here.</i>

806
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,322
No, there are two guests missing!

807
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,368
You need to make this your top priority!

808
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,641
Just do it, man.

809
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,649
<i>there is a lot of guests missing.
we are doing the best we can.</i>

810
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,370
Okay. Fine.
I will do it myself.

811
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,324
<i>Do you think I am the one
you need to be worried about right now?</i>

812
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,771
<i>Back off!</i>

813
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,606
What happened here?

814
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,329
Dude.

815
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,885
Off-road.

816
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,809
But they told us to go back.

817
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,806
I am just worried you are not getting

818
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,486
the full Jurassic World experience.

819
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,326
Claire!

820
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,007
I need you. I need your help.
Okay.

821
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,009
My nephews, they are out in the Valley.

822
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,600
Please, if anything happens to them...

823
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,131
How old?

824
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,406
The older one, he is high school age.
The younger one, he is...

825
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,925
he is a few years...

826
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
You do not know how old your nephews are?

827
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,403
No, no.
Bad idea, bad idea.

828
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,481
Great idea.

829
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,369
No!
we are going to get arrested.

830
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,527
they will shave our heads,

831
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,404
and we are going to have to make
root   in the toilet.

832
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,885
What are you talking about?

833
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,407
There.

834
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,730
You see?
I told you.

835
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,484
you are welcome. Up close and personal
with four dinosauruses.

836
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,210
<i>Ankylosaurus.</i>

837
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,722
We should not be here.
And there is five dinosaurs.

838
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,443
are not you supposed to be
a genius or something?

839
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,601
Look.

840
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,688
One, two, three,

841
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,046
four.

842
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,485
Five.

843
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,850
Go, go, go!
 !

844
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,006
Hold it together, man!

845
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,005
Drive! Drive!
Go!

846
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,127
we are safe in here, right?

847
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,924
Yeah.
they are totally safe.

848
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,889
Come on.

849
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,645
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

850
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,761
Zach.

851
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,405
I almost got it.

852
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,561
Zach?
Yeah?

853
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,160
Look.
What?

854
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,321
Go!
Go!

855
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,170
Gray, go!

856
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,841
 !

857
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,766
we are going to have to jump.
I cannot.

858
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,486
Are you ready?
One, two... Come on!

859
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,250
We jumped.

860
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,930
Stay in the car.

861
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,721
Hi.

862
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,806
Hi.

863
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,241
I know, I know.

864
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,730
it is all right.

865
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,845
All right, girl.

866
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,121
Okay.

867
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,730
Okay, Okay.

868
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,406
you are okay.

869
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,969
It did not eat them.

870
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,930
it is killing for sport.

871
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,249
Units on standby, ready for go.

872
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,289
Good.
Hold off on that live feed.

873
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,169
we have got an evolving situation here.

874
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,248
Did they give you the green light yet?

875
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,646
They will.

876
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,686
Owen, we have a situation here.

877
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,160
<i>Hey, there.
I am Jimmy Fallon.</i>

878
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,010
<i>Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,</i>

<i>Hey, there.
Your safety is our main concern.</i>

881
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,602
<i>Now just relax and enjoy the ride.</i>

882
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,807
No, no, no.

883
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,764
Hey.

884
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,723
They made it out.

885
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,049
My  , they jumped.

886
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,481
Brave kids.

887
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,126
Zach!
Gray!

888
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,164
Hey, I am not one of your   animals.

889
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,931
Listen, those kids are still alive,

890
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,403
but you and I will not be
if you continue to scream like that.

891
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,127
So...

892
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,771
You can pick up their scent, cannot you?
Track their footprints?

893
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,569
I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.

894
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,642
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?

895
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,688
You get back.
I will find them.

896
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,081
No, we will find them.

897
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,520
you will last two minutes in there.

898
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,164
Less, in those ridiculous shoes.

899
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,040
What is that supposed to mean?

900
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,120
It means I am ready to go.

901
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,047
Okay.

902
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,089
let us get one thing straight.
I am in charge out here.

903
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,969
You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it.

904
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,844
Excuse me?
Just relax.

905
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,680
it is just like taking a stroll
through the woods.

906
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,525
65 million years ago.

907
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,211
Stay here.

908
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,970
You still have those matches?

909
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,084
Here you go.

910
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,446
Gray!

911
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,367
1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige.

912
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,840
You remember when we fixed up
Granddad's old Malibu, right?

913
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,444
Yeah.

914
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,325
Every time this thing kills,
it moves further south.

915
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,970
it is headed right for the park.

916
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,201
Why would she come here?

917
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,044
She can sense thermal radiation.

918
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,167
Our emergency measures

919
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,641
just put all the warm bodies in one place.

920
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,526
Sir... InGen.

921
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,486
Hoskins.

922
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,966
I know who you are.

923
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,168
Then you know why I am here.

924
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,967
I have been working for two years

925
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,480
on an application for those Raptors.

926
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,848
They can hunt and   that creature.

927
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,247
But your program
was to test their intelligence.

928
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,970
Yeah, it was.
And we did.

929
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,409
And in the process, we learned something.

930
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,006
They follow orders.

931
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,168
You see, the solution to your crisis

932
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,844
is standing right in front of you.

933
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,321
Let me be as clear as I can.

934
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,841
No <i>Velociraptors</i>
are going to be set loose on this island.

935
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,087
 .

936
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,365
you are out of your mind!

937
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,601
What are you going to do
with all these people?

938
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,523
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?

939
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,842
They have no place to go.

940
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,042
That thing is a killing machine!

941
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,848
And it will not stop.

942
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,686
Okay.

943
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,649
I intend to personally
look into your project

944
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:16,601
to determine its viability within
the moral principles of this company.

945
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,890
Okay, boss.

946
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,410
what is your next move?

947
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,448
Sir, I cannot get a hold of your instructor.

948
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,729
Never mind.
he is likely caught up in the evacuation.

949
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,207
you are sure there is nobody else
who can fly a helicopter?

950
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,327
We do not need anyone else.

951
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,964
You think it is out there?

952
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,608
I mean, I know for a fact
it is definitely not out there, all right?

953
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,171
we are totally safe.

954
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,246
Here, go take this.

955
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,603
you are stronger than me.

956
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,206
All right.
Turn it over.

957
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,965
It works!

958
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,968
I thought you failed your driver's test.

959
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,889
No, only the driving part.

960
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,730
This one of theirs?

961
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,847
Yeah.

962
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,647
That road goes straight back to the park.

963
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,001
How did they even get
one of these things started?

964
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,002
Lowery, we found her.

965
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,605
South of the Gyrosphere Valley,

966
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,444
between the old park and the Aviary.

967
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,251
Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
<i>Yes.</i>

968
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,051
Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time.

969
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,650
ACU is airborne.

970
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,802
<i>They took the helicopter.</i>

971
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,405
who is flying it?

972
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,121
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?

973
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,163
Afghanistan, sir.

974
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,768
Did your general
ever fly into battle with you?

975
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,284
Got it!
Got it.

976
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,440
<i>We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary.</i>

977
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,686
<i>Proceed and engage.</i>

978
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,968
Come on!
Look alive, boys!

979
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,165
Look alive!

980
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,685
10 of the clock!
By the birdcage!

981
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,451
No, no, no!

982
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,966
Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.

983
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,409
Pull up! Pull up!
Up, up, up!

984
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
We have a breach in the Aviary.

985
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,766
Trees, the trees!
Go! Go!

986
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,322
Okay, that is it.

987
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,925
we are safe now.

988
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,526
Go, go!

989
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,210
Go!
 !

990
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,801
Hurry up!

991
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,766
Hey!

992
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,841
Help!

993
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,251
Open the gate!
Let us in!

994
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,044
Open it up!

995
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,690
Come on!
Come on!

996
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,444
that is a first.

997
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,443
Open the gate!
Open the gate!

998
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,760
Let us in!

999
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,445
<i>Attention Aviary employees,
there has been a containment breach.</i>

1000
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,521
Hello?

1001
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,047
Claire, we spotted the boys
on surveillance.

1002
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,121
they are approaching the west gate.

1003
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,241
I am headed there now.

1004
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,167
Okay. Stay right there. I am on my way.
Stay right with them.

1005
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,845
Hey!

1006
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,291
Get on!

1007
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,243
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly</i>

1008
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,528
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

1009
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,406
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

1010
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,921
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

1011
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,371
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, due to a

1012
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,370
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

1013
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,320
<i>All units, take position on boardwalk.</i>

1014
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,609
<i>Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.</i>

1015
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,847
Claire, come on!

1016
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,685
Stop running!

1017
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,047
Wait.

1018
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,686
do not just stand there!

1019
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,844
Go!
Get inside now!

1020
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,001
Zach!

1021
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,046
Gray!

1022
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,371
Aunt Claire!
Go, go!

1023
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,805
Claire!

1024
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,845
No!
Hold your...

1025
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,204
Is that Aunt Claire?

1026
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,683
it is them!
Zach!

1027
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,120
Gray!

1028
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,811
My  ! Thank  ! Thank  !
What happened? What is this?

1029
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,160
Are you okay?

1030
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,961
Where did you go?
Why did not you come back?

1031
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,487
I was so worried about you.
who is that?

1032
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,761
We work together.

1033
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,081
Hey.

1034
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,361
We have got to go.
Okay.

1035
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,771
Come on, come on.

1036
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,369
Hey!
You guys cannot just be walking up in...

1037
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,805
Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.

1038
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,806
The new mission
is to prevent further loss of life.

1039
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,245
Who are these guys?

1040
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,811
I am glad you asked.

1041
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,051
you are all relieved of duty.

1042
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,082
there is a new team on the ground.

1043
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,730
Lowery, I am on my way back to you.

1044
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,926
<i>that is a bad idea.</i>

1045
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,003
The board assigned emergency ops

1046
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,889
to InGen's private security division.

1047
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,048
This guy Hoskins is in charge.

1048
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,647
And he has this insane plan to use
the Raptors to hunt the <i>Indominus.</i>

1049
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,688
What do you mean "use the Raptors"?

1050
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,848
Son of a  !

1051
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,565
You should not say " ."

1052
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,928
Take the kids.
Get them someplace safe.

1053
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,049
You got this!
Go faster!

1054
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,120
  it, drive!

1055
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,085
This does not feel safe.

1056
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,446
Can we stay with you?

1057
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,522
I am never leaving you as long as you live.

1058
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,801
No, him.

1059
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,645
Yeah, definitely him.

1060
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,250
<i>Hey!
Right here.</i>

1061
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,885
<i>Right here.</i>

1062
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,883
<i>She looks at what she wants.</i>

1063
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,523
Usually what she wants to eat.

1064
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,683
The mother hen has finally arrived.

1065
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,401
Get the   out of here
and stay away from my animals.

1066
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,243
Hoskins, you wanted this to happen,
you son of a  !

1067
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,890
Jesus!

1068
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,005
How many more people have to die

1069
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,168
before this mission starts
to make sense to you?

1070
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,124
it is not a mission.
it is a field test.

1071
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,687
This is an InGen situation now.

1072
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,762
Okay, there are going to be cruise ships

1073
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,683
that show up here at first light.

1074
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,240
Everybody's going to get off this island.

1075
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,330
you are going to watch a news story
tomorrow about how you all saved lives.

1076
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,640
No, better yet,

1077
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,246
how your animals saved lives.

1078
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,689
they have never been out of containment.
it is crazy.

1079
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,484
let us move it out!

1080
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,923
This is happening!

1081
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,924
With or without you.

1082
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,927
We know that she is in sector five.

1083
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,726
This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
it is a scent drill.

1084
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,645
we have done it about a
thousand times with these animals.

1085
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,167
When they get on target,
and they will get on target,

1086
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,322
wait to engage.

1087
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,926
<i>Velociraptors</i> are pack hunters.

1088
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,651
They like to herd the animal
into a   zone.

1089
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,960
that is when we take our shot.

1090
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,844
Get a clear shot, wait on my command,

1091
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,570
and give her everything you got.

1092
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,810
We got one good target, gentlemen.
Do not shoot my Raptors.

1093
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,201
Please.

1094
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,563
Easy, Blue.

1095
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,125
Easy.

1096
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,720
Attagirl.

1097
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,329
You do not scare me.

1098
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,686
Owen.

1099
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,967
Are they safe?

1100
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,921
No, they are not.

1101
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,769
What are their names?

1102
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,251
Well, you got Charlie.

1103
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,048
there is Echo.
Here is Delto.

1104
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,730
This one's called Blue.
She is the beto.

1105
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,721
who is the alpha?

1106
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,450
you are looking at him, kid.

1107
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,366
See?

1108
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,885
Totally safe.

1109
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,882
All right, get in.
Come on.

1110
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,320
Get in there.

1111
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,564
If you need me, I will be right up front.

1112
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,971
Just open that window.

1113
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,001
Okay?

1114
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,806
Put your seat belts on.

1115
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,048
Okay, so just...

1116
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,531
Hold hands.

1117
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,127
Nothing's getting in here, right?

1118
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,367
Hey.

1119
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,562
Do you remember that ghost
at the old house?

1120
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,449
Remember, the one in the garage?

1121
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,329
I protected you, right?

1122
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,644
You made a battle axe out of
a ruler and a paper plate.

1123
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,965
Yeah.

1124
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,884
See, nothing is going to get you
while I am around, okay?

1125
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,201
But you are not always going to be around.

1126
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,885
Yeah, well...

1127
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,971
Hey...

1128
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,167
we are brothers, okay?

1129
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:03,001
we will always be brothers,
and we will always come back to one another.

1130
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,521
No matter what.

1131
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,881
No matter what?

1132
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,011
No matter what.

1133
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,850
Awesome.

1134
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,011
Here we go.

1135
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,403
Your boyfrienthes a bad- .

1136
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,490
Imagine if we
had these puppies in Tora Bora.

1137
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,160
Are you recording this thing?

1138
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,131
they are slowing down.

1139
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,811
They got something.

1140
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,607
You know what?
No, no, no.

1141
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,170
You guys are not going to watch this.

1142
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,480
Keep the window closed.

1143
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,371
Something's wrong.

1144
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,605
they are communicating.

1145
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,283
I know why they
would not tell us what it is made of.

1146
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,361
Why?

1147
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,328
That thing's part Raptor.

1148
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,881
what is taking them so long?
Light it up!

1149
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,325
Engage!

1150
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,405
My  .

1151
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,051
Watch your six.

1152
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,570
Raptors got a new alpha.

1153
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,401
To the vehicles now!

1154
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,602
Fall back!

1155
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,210
No!

1156
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,088
No!
Blue!

1157
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,560
My  .

1158
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,248
Is everybody dead?

1159
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,164
No, no, no.
Everyone is fine.

1160
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,526
do not lie to him.

1161
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,001
he is scared.
it is okay to lie when people are scared.

1162
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,122
I want to go home.

1163
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,607
Sweetheart, you will, okay?
I promise.

1164
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,609
Tomorrow you will be home,

1165
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,485
and your mother will
never let me see you again.

1166
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,409
Get out of here!
Go!

1167
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,043
they are coming!

1168
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,248
Just hold on back there.

1169
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,651
Turn it on.
I do not know how.

1170
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,006
Now!

1171
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,844
Are you boys okay?

1172
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,570
Did you see that?

1173
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,449
I cannot wait to tell Mom.

1174
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,683
Please, no.
Do not tell your mother about that, ever.

1175
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,171
Owen!
Owen!

1176
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,970
We have got to get indoors.
Follow me.

1177
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,409
Lowery, we are headed your way.
Call in a chopper.

1178
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,046
Everything must be accounted for.

1179
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,282
I want all backup generators online.

1180
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,527
Where have you been?

1181
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,889
Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left.

1182
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,320
I am taking everything off-site.

1183
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,731
The embryos are safe here.

1184
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,161
<i>They can live up to eight
weeks on the generators.</i>

1185
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,847
No, no. You listen.
The park's going to be Chapter 11 by morning.

1186
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,610
<i>Okay?
Our little side projectos</i>

1187
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:39,681
<i>about to get a shot in the arm.</i>

1188
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,807
I do not want a bunch of lawyers

1189
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,486
messing around with something
that they do not understand.

1190
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,721
<i>You get it?</i>

1191
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,481
<i>Hey?</i>

1192
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,563
I am going to take that as a yes.

1193
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to thank you for your patience.</i>

1194
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,442
<i>The next ferry will be leaving
in 45 minutes.</i>

1195
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,490
<i>If you require immediate medical attention,</i>

1196
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,927
<i>please report to
the nearest health service station.</i>

1197
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,240
Is this what you had in mind?

1198
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,563
Okay, people. We have an extraction point
at the east dock.

1199
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,721
Hey.

1200
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,121
They said we had to evacuate.
there is a boat.

1201
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,209
You coming?

1202
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,842
Someone has to stay behind.

1203
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,563
No.
I have a boyfriend.

1204
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,524
I did not know that you guys were,
like, together-together.

1205
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,681
We are.

1206
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,280
that is good.
You do not mention him, ever.

1207
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,521
No, I am at work.

1208
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,091
No, no, no.
Yeah.

1209
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,207
Well...
Yeah, okay.

1210
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,281
Great.
Great.

1211
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,361
Okay.
Okay.

1212
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,680
Are you going to be okay?
Yeah.

1213
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,005
Okay, bye.

1214
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,249
where is Hoskins?

1215
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,641
he is sending you and the assets
to a secure location.

1216
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,007
But our deal is still intact?

1217
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,044
do not worry.
you will be well taken care of. let us go!

1218
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,282
<i>Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.</i>

1219
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,568
<i>We hope you enjoyed your adventure.</i>

1220
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,291
<i>do not forget to visit the gift shop,
and remember...</i>

1221
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,848
<i>it is always happy hour at Margaritaville.</i>

1222
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,806
Come on, come on.
Go inside.

1223
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,964
Control room.
That way.

1224
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,601
They evacuated the lab.

1225
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,565
What are you doing?

1226
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,003
I am afraid that is above your pay grade,
honey.

1227
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,126
where is Henry?

1228
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,923
Dr. Wu, he works for us.

1229
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,730
that is not a real dinosaur.

1230
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,280
No, it am not, kid.

1231
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,730
But somebody's have got to
make sure that this company has a future.

1232
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,521
Imagine,

1233
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,841
that one, a fraction of the size,

1234
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,366
deadly, intelligent,

1235
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:09,286
able to hide from
the most advanced military technology.

1236
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,842
A living weapon
unlike anything we have ever seen.

1237
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,920
You see...

1238
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,050
Millions of years of evolution,
what did we learn?

1239
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,561
Nature is the gift that just...

1240
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,131
 !

1241
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,606
Easy.

1242
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,529
Easy, boy.

1243
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,881
Easy.
Hey, hey.

1244

01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:44,484
Easy.

1246
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,770
I am on your side.

1247
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,251
No, boys. Boys, this way.

Come on.

Easy.

1251
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,721
Easy.

1252
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,405

More what?

1256
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,087
Teeth.

We need more teeth.

1258
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,171
Okay, so you just wait here.

1259
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,607
it is going to be fine.

1260
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,770
Lowery, are you still there?

1261
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,560
Hey, where are you?

1262
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,563
I need you to open Paddock 9.

1263
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,566
Paddock 9?

1264
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,520
You kidding?

1265
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,603
  it, Lowery, be a man
and do something for once in your life.

1266
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,808
Why do you have to make it personal?

1267
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,811
Run!

1268
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,125
Go!
Go, go!

1269
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,210
My  , it is your parents.

1270
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,286
Come on, come on.

1271
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,720
Are you okay?
Baby.

1272
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,603
I am so sorry.

1273
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,085
Are you okay?

1274
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,680
Come here.

1275
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,885
Sweetie.

1276
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,685
So, what do we do now?

1277
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,169
Probably stick together.

1278
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,525
For survival.
