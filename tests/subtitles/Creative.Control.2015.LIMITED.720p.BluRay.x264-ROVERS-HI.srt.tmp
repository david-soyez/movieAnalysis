I do not think it is clear
that it is back in the chair.

SCOTT: All right, so "Phalinex,"
big punch, also "back," a big punch.

508

- Mike.
- PILOT: Yes?

509
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,660
That was great. let us just make sure
to punch both "Phalinex"

510
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,420
and the word "back," please.

511
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,820
Yeah, it is like a one-two punch.
it is like Phalinex put me back!

Mike, you are getting there.

517
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,780
Okay, I am sorry, I am just confused.

518
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,940
How are we supposed to know
that he is a pilot?

519
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,884
he is wearing a pilotos outfit
and he is in a cockpit.

520
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,291
Well, I am not buying it.

521
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,780
Hit the word "pilot" harder
so that I can hear it.

522
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,690
He could say, "I am a pilot,"
at the beginning.

523
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,130
- Is the other camera here?
- it is coming, it is on its way.

524
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,129
Okay, Scott, I do not know.
Maybe it is a costume thing,

525
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,380
- but I am not seeing a pilot.
- Okay, we will fix it.

526

I just...

527
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,860
I do not understand why you have to make...

528
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,580
Listen, you are not paying...
Okay. He looks like an Mto employee!

529
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,980
I need him to look like a pilot.

530
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,764
- I do not see why that is difficult.
- Absolutely.

really great vintage bomber's jacket.

Do you want to slip this on real quick?
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

534
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,249
He could be, like, a really cool, edgy pilot
who wears his own jacket over his uniform.

535
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,525
Let me see this.

it is okay, though,
Govindas has got it, so, we are good.

- It will not happen again.
- Right.

563
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,700
No, I am really sorry. I am just, I am kind of
going through a weird transition right now,

and Mercury's in retrograde, so.

Hey, um, listen, Juliette,

567
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,900
I am thinking maybe Govindas
takes this slot from this point forward.

568
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,923
I think that is the right move.

- But those are my students.
- Well, technically, no.

570
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,260
No, yeah. I have been
building this class for like a year, Gary.

571
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,620
Right. But it is like this, okay.

572
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,780
- it is like when an instructor comes on time...
- Mmm-hmm.

573
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,180
...and draws a lot of students here,

574
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,100
then we help more people
and make more money. You get that, right?

575
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,044

that he   his students, right?

with Augmento organically.

with the augmented technology and it is cool,
but it is a little bit...

843
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,100
Hmm, I do not know, a little bit too much
in the entertainment arena.

844

So, and that is cool, obviously

845

But I am kind of interested
in deeper implications with the technology.

Yeah.

Yeah. Sounds good.

I think that that is heavier.
that is a heavier concept.

851
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,700
You know, as an example,
there was this homeless lady,

852
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,780
that I did a 3-D rendering
of under a bridge.

853
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,420
And I was like, "Wow, how could I
incorporate that into my reality?"

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,980
And it was absolutely

855

- and completely horrifying.

"I should have confronted that."

862
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,220
But now we give people
the option to confront it now

863
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,420

going on with this.

01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,700
You know, you would not answer my texts,
you did not talk to me,

1176
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,370
you were like a stranger.

1177
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,340
And I did not have anything.
I did not have a home anymore.

1178
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:03,460
And then he came
and he brought me to the ceremony.

1179
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,860
And I had the most amazing experience.

1180
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,300
It was like I could see
everything from the outside.

1181
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,500
Like all of the pain
and all of the suffering,

1182
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,780
and everything that I did to you
and you did to me and everybody.

1183
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,940
And everybody in the whole world,
there were like thousands of us.

1184
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,500
And, and we were all one, though,

1185
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,820
because we are all
just people on the inside, you know.

1186
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,900
We all just want to be good,
and we just want to be loved.

1187
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,209
- Are you   high right now?
- No.

1188
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,420
Look, I understand
how this all sounds, okay?

1189
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,020
But everything just collapsed
into this one second,

1190
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,690
and he just, he sang to me.

1191
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,300
- He sang to you?
- Yes.

1192
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,811
Jesus Christ.

1193
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,900
- David, why will not you just listen to me?
- Because you are ranting.

1194
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,220
And I have no idea
what you are trying to say to me.

1195
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,448
Well, can you let me explain, then?

1196
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,731
you are worried we had  .

1197
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,281
Did you?

1198
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,921
Yes.

1199
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,166
Oh,  .

1200
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,325
do not be mad.

1201
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:17,380
David, it was incredible.
We were at the peak of this whole experience.

1202
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,420
And I was looking into his eyes,
and that is...

1203
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,444
- Please, stop.
- No, no, no. And that is when I saw you.

1204
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,166
I saw you.

1205
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,780
And I realized that loving him,

1206
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,487
was loving you,
was loving me because we are all one.

1207
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,890
Did you   him here?

1208
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,420
Did you   him in our bed?

1209
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,284
David, I love you.

1210
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,260
I love you.

1211
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:54,260
And all this   that I have been
doing to myself and doing to you,

1212
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,340
and blaming you for and blaming me,
it is not us.

1213
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,700
You know?

1214
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,771
you are an addict. But you are not...
you are not addicted to the pills, okay?

1215
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,860
you are just addicted to this
like, misery and pain,

1216
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,940
and the cycle of misery and pain
and you bring me into it,

1217
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,769
but we do not have to do that anymore.

1218
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,651
We do not have to do that
because it is not real.

1219
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,884
What do you mean, "it is not real?"

1220
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,723
I do not know how else to explain it.

1221
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,860
- I had this incredible  .
- Oh, my  .

1222
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,460
No, no, no, please wait,
just listen to me, okay?

1223
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,780
because, no, I had this  .

1224
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,140
And it was like my body left me
and I just became, like, light.

1225
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,447
And I saw you.

1226
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,208
In nature. And we were together.
And we knew how to talk to each other.

1227
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,925
And now I know it must be real
because you are here.

1228
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,220
Wait, when was this?

1229
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,004
Like a half an hour ago.

1230
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,900
The   where your body disappeared?

1231
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,404
Look, I know it is a lot to take in, okay?
And I understand if you do not believe me.

1232
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,521
No.

1233
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,126
I understand.

1234
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,489
No, I mean, I can kind of see it.

1235
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,860
You can?

1236
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,281
I mean,
I have no idea what you are talking about.

1237
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,920
(CHUCKLES)

1238
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,965
But I believe you.

1239
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,140
Really?

1240
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,811
The city is killing us
in small increments.

1241
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,325
(LAUGHS)

1242
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,780
You used to always say that.

1243
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,380
- I thought you were just complaining.
- I was.

1244
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,561
No.

1245
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,160
You were right.

1246
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,380
We have to get out of here.

1247
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,482
We do not have to go right now.

1248
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,841
Yeah.

1249
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,020
we are going to move Upstate.

1250
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,900
- Get an old farmhouse.
- (GASPS)

1251
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,900
You know, my mom has that friend, Wendy,
who buys all that property Upstate,

1252
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,860
- and fixes it up.
- Yeah. Right.

1253
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,900
We could do that.

1254
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,580
We could find one with a barn
and I will fix it up.

1255
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,660
You do not know how to fix up a barn.

1256
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,220
Yeah, I will learn how to fix up a barn
and I will learn blacksmithing.

1257
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,580
- Oh, you are not going to be a blacksmith.
- No, I will write my book in there.

1258
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,940
Mmm. You should finish that,
it was so good.

1259
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,140
You can teach yoga
to the elderly and infirm.

1260
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,340
(LAUGHS)

1261
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,340
No, I am going to learn how to cook.
I am going to be a really good chef.

1262
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,820
Okay. I do not believe you, but...

1263
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,685
- I am really hungry. Should I call Wendy?
- Yes.

1264
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,044
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1265
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,860
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1266
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,531
We should find a place
without cell phone service.

1267
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,460
Ugh.

1268
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,780
- What the   do you want?
- David, hey, hang on.

1269
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,620
- Satan.
- This thing on the glasses...

1270
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,580
- Yes.
- The thing you made of Sophie,

1271
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,700
it is incredible, you little genius!

1272
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,460
I do not know
what the   you are talking about, man.

1273
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,848
That avatar thing.
it is amazing, they are freaking out!

1274
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,961
Holy  .

1275
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,525
David, listen to me,

1276
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,731
they are freaking out, okay?

1277
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,420
They stopped the rollout.

1278
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,140
They want to make the Sophie avatar
the spokesperson for Augmento.

1279
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,780
they will de-emphasize the   stuff.
a, Gabe says it is implied.

1280
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,780
Well, you already fired me, Scott,
so I do not know what the   you want.

1281
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,486
No, they want to redo everything!

1282
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:54,660
(CHUCKLES) We have to go to Malaysia.
they are on the phone with them right now

1283
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,940
They said,
"Bring us the man who made this!"

1284
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,500
Well, what did you tell them?

1285
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,602
I said, "I will call him right now!"

1286
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,420
David, we are gold. This is huge.

1287
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,260
I know Malaysia sounds far and it is far
as  , but we will do first class.

1288
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,900
it is, it is awesome.
we will get wasted, we will pass out...

1289
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,650
(SCOTT CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1290
