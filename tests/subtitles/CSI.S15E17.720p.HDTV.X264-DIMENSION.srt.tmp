00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:32,299
I know a place we can hang,
just the two of us.

00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,970
Come on.

35
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,405
let us go.

36
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,783
Nobody should have
to die like this.

37
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,453
Lot of blood drops
on the floor

38
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:56,290
over here, so I do not think
he puked himself to death.

39
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,692
Pretty big gash.

40
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,094
I-It looks like somebody

41
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,797
cut his throat and just
left him to bleed out

42
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,265
in the toilet there.

43
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,334
The body is
still warm.

44
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,036
The rigor has not
even started.

45
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,378
he is been dead
less than an hour.

46
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,306
Hang on a
second.

47
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,274
You see something?

48
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:18,253
Looks like some type
of bug carcass.

49
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,081
Could have
fallen off the killer.

50
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,184
I will scoop it up,
get it back to the lab.

51
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:26,420
Yeah, now.

52
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,821
there is no wallet.

53
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:29,189
But we got...

54
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,924
a cell phone.

55
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,460
Maybe we could get an I.D.

56
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,095
Locked.

57
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,297
Use his thumb.

58
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,736
Got to love technology.

59
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,275
According to the phone's I.D.,

60
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:50,244
the victimys name
is Pete Corday.

61
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,246
His camera app
was open.

62
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,148
Some of these pictures
were time-stamped

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,849
right before
he was murdered.

64
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,851
Maybe he got a shot
of the killer.

65
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:00,054
it is him and a girl.

66
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,357
Looks like he is having
a pretty good time.

67
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,894
Mm. Right up
until someone ended it.

79
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,321
Talked to the janitor
who found the body.

80
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,223
He said he got suspicious
when he saw

81
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,882
the "Closed for Cleaning" sign
on the restroom door.

82
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,060
Killer was trying

83
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,828
to buy more time
till the body was found.

84
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,297
Got blood in the sink--
he must have cleaned up in here.

85
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,531
So the victimys
throat

86
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,167
was slashed over the toilet
to catch the blood.

87
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,841
<i>Then the knife</i>
<i>was washed off in the sink,</i>

88
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,142
put the sign on the door.

89
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:08,610
Smart.
You know, he was

90
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,446
with this girl right
before he was murdered.

91
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:13,315
I figure either
she was involved,

92
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,550
or at the very least
she is a witness.

93
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,656
Any idea who she is?

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,089
No. Finlay's pulling
surveillance now.

95
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,324
Seeing if we can
track her movements.

96
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,760
I mean, maybe
somebody knows her.

97
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,561
Well, that is
a Dempsey's bag.

98
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:28,563
Judging by the size,
I would say jewelry or makeup.

99
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,033
We could show her photo
to the store clerks.

100
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,401
If she paid
with a credit card,

101
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,436
- we might be able to get a name.
<i>-  Russell.</i>

102
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:37,172
Yeah?
Got a lead on our mystery girl.

103
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:39,508
The credit card that
she used earlier today

104
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,743
belongs to a guy
named John Nolan.

105
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:44,179
Nolan. Why do I know that name?
he is the director

106
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:45,747
of the crime lab
in San Diego.

107
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,983
Right. She used his credit card
here in Vegas?

108
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,758
Did he report it stolen?

109
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,721
Not yet, but according
to Nolands assistant,

110
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,955
he is here in town
for a family wedding.

111
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,358
Nick's talking to him now;
says he knows him.

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
Nolan offered him a
job a few years ago.

113
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:03,532
Hey, John...

114
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:06,101
sorry to drag you down here.

115
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,503
I thought you were investigating
the   of a young man.

116
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,172
We are, and a
person of interest

117
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,041
has been using your credit card.

118
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:15,577
Do you recognize
that girl?

119
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,313
Oh, my  .

120
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,781
it is care of.
care of?

121
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:21,516
She is my 13-year-old daughter.

122
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,453
Do you, a...

123
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:26,455
do you know the victim,

124
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:27,789
Pete Corday?

125
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,107
No, I have never seen him before.
Who is he?

126
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,726
23-year-old
from Phoenix.

127
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,795
he is got a couple
of misdemeanors

128
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:35,097
for drug possession.

129
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,467
Why would she be hanging out
with a guy like that?

130
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,268
Where is she, Nick?

131
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,736
Can I see her?

132
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,274
We do not know where she is.

133
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,809
What?

134
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,678
when is the last time
you saw her?

135
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,180
a... at 10:00 this morning.

136
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,449
She wanted to go
to the mall with Lexi.

137
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,118
Lexi?
Yeah, my oldest daughter. She is 17.

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,220
They do not get to see
each other very often.

139
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,421
Why is that?

140
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:01,456
Well, after the divorce,
Lexi wanted to live

141
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,159
with her mother here in Vegas.
I was dead set against it.

142
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,994
Tori, my ex.
She had rather be

143
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:07,229
a friend than a parent.

144
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:09,498
Have you talked to
either one of them

145
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,272
since this morning?

146
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,566
No, I was at a lunch
with out-of-town guests.

147
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,570
They did not show up.
I texted them-- they never answered.

148
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,572
Okay, what about
the ex-wife?

149
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,441
Or family members?

150
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:21,243
No one's heard from them.

151
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:22,777
Give me their
phone numbers.

152
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,846
we will ping their cells,
we will track them down.

153
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,615
Of course.

154
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:30,485
And I need a current
picture of Lexi.

155
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,659
it is a picture that was taken
at the rehearsal dinner

156
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,227
yesterday.

157
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,932
I am going to find your girls.

158
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:46,034
If anyone can, it is you.

159
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,404
Hey, boss.
Yeah?

160
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,073
What do you got for me, David?

161
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,209
Hadrurus Arizonensis.

162
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:55,510
Otherwise known as

163
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:58,480
the giant desert
hairy scorpion.

164
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:00,749
Nick found a piece of
the molted exoskeleton

165
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,484
next to Pete Corday's
body in the restroom.

166
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,119
You were able to trace it?
Unfortunately no.

167
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:06,555
The giant desert
hairy scorpion

168
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,290
is quite common in Nevathe.

169
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,792
You know, last spring
my cousin Karen

170
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,261
went to go put on her
running shoes for her daily jog.

171
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,597
did not know one was hiding
in there; it stung her big toe.

172
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,465
Was she okay?
Oh, yeah. But the venom

173
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,435
is no more harmful
than a bee sting.

174
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,437
Ah.

175
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,271
Hey, Doc.
Hey. I just finished

176
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,806
Pete Corday's
autopsy.

177
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,441
He died from
exsanguination

178
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,810
due to massive sharp-force traumom.
Can you tell us

179
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,879
anything about our killer
from the wound?

180
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:34,015
Depth and angle indicate
a right-handed individual

181
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:37,852
with considerable strength,
in all likelihood male.

182
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:39,721
That rules out
the Nolan sisters.

183
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:41,723
Okay. So what do we know?

184
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,925
care of Nolan was
with Pete Corday

185
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,660
right before he was killed.

186
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,996
And now both she and her sister
are missing.

187
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,164
You think

188
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,966
Corday's killer
has the girls?

189
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,467
If they saw his face,

190
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:54,769
maybe he took them
to keep them quiet.

191
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:58,139
And if that is the case,
we need to find them, fast.

192
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,674
Hey.
Hey.

193
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,276
Were you able to
pull up the footage

194
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:03,612
from outside the bathroom?
That camera was not working.

195
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,748
Figures.
Yeah. So I retraced the girls' steps.

196
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,818
We know that they bought makeup
at Dempsey's at 12:53.

197
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,520
because that camera was working.
And look what I found.

198
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:15,557
Oh, that is our victim,
Pete Corday.

199
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,425
who is the other guy?

200
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,761
Obviously, a close personal
friend of Lexi's.

201
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,797
I am putting him through
facial recognition right now.

202
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:33,308
He has a rap sheet.
Axel Vargas, age 25.

203
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,143
Drug possession, burglary...

204
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,311
pandering?
he is a  ?

205
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,746
No, worse.
Look at that.

206
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:39,648
Federal charge--
tried to take

207
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,716
an underage girl into Mexico.

208
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:43,451
That sounds like
  trafficking.

209
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,087
Maybe that is what he is
got planned for Lexi and care of.

210
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,024
what is that tattoo on his neck?

211
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,825
Let me zoom in.

212
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,963
A scorpion.

213
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:02,037
Nice tattoo on your neck.

214
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,039
You like scorpions?

215
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,475
they are cool.
Keep any as pets?

216
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,411
No. Why?

217
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,946
We found a piece of a
scorpion exoskeleton

218
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,149
on the body of
a   victim.

219
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:15,717
Your buddy, actually.

220
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,252
Pete Corday.

221
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,987
We know you
were with him,

222
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,556
Lexi and care of Nolan
at the mall this afternoon.

223
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:24,025
Now he is dead and
they are missing.

224
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,961
it is got nothing
to do with me.

225
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,764
You have a history of forcing
young girls into prostitution.

226
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,634
you would get top dollar
for Lexi and care of, so what happened?

227
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:35,470
Did Pete decide he wanted to
keep the girls for himself?

228
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:37,372
Or maybe he decided
he wanted a cut.

229
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,341
I did not   Pete.
Where are the girls?

230
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,877
I am telling you, I do not know.

231
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,113
I met Lexi a week ago
at a bar.

232
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:47,749
She wanted me to meet her
at the mall today, so I went.

233
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,751
We hooked up in a dressing room,
and I split.

234
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,386
where did you go?
Work.

235
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:52,520
I am a bartender
at McCarthy's.

236
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,556
Cops picked me up
in the middle of a shift, too,

237
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:55,724
and I missed a whole day's pay.

238
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,092
I am going to need
to talk to your boss

239
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,160
and verify when you showed up.

240
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,431
Nick said Nolands
putting on a brave face,

241
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,966
but, obviously,
he is upset.

242
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,368
Well, we have
both been there.

243
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,702
Father's worst
nightmare.

244
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:10,171
Our girls made it.
Hopefully, his will, too.

245
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,874
Listen, I want the department
to do everything in its power--

246
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,642
resources, personnel,
I do not care--

247
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:17,412
whatever it takes to bring those
girls back and close this case.

248
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,481
Absolutely.
Oh, and do me a favor.

249
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,749
John's a good guy.

250
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,016
As a professional courtesy,

251
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:24,052
let us give him access,
keep him up to date.

252
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,487
Yeah, I will make sure
everybody knows.

253
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,889
Thanks.

254
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:31,059
Any luck tracking down Lexi
and care of's cell phones?

255
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,128
Thankfully,
they are still transmitting.

256
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,030
I have triangulated their location
to somewhere in North Las Vegas.

257
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,832
All right. Can
you get any closer?

258
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,134
I am trying.

259
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:49,544
There they are--
off the 215 near Sahara.

260
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:50,578
Signals are not moving.

261
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,013
Could be where
the girls are being held.

262
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,682
Or where their bodies
were dumped.

263
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:58,319
I will call for backup.

264
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,306
Big search area.

265
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:21,609
Yeah, but their phones
are still transmitting.

266
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,912
They should be
right around here.

267
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,957
I got one.

268
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,160
Screen's broken.

269
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,931
Here.

270
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,402
Their phones were tossed.

271
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,206
Yeah, but I do not see
any bodies.

272
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,607
It means the girls
could still be alive.

273
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:56,444
It opened up to a video.

274
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:59,814
Looks like it was taken
inside a vehicle.

275
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:04,586
Where are you taking us?

276
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:08,223
Please, just let us go.

277
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,692
Shut up.

278
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:13,628
My sister's only 13.
She is just a kid.

279
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,097
You do not need both of us.
Just please, let her go!

280
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,299
You    !

281
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,635
Ooh.

282
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:23,404
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

283
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:26,207
Lexi!
No!

284
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,576
Lexi got her
captor on camera.

285
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:32,046
could not see much of his face,
but no scorpion tattoo.

286
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:33,414
That was not Axel Vargas.

287
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,651
Then who was it, and what
does he want with these girls?

288
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:52,445
Nick!

289
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,248
Nick? Just heard
the suspect was released.

290
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,916
What the  's going on?

291
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,318
Yeah, his alibi
checked out.

292
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,788
But he was with Lexi and care of
right before they disappeared.

293
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,997
He has to be on the top
of the suspect list.

294
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,180
Yeah, I just saw the video

295
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,787
that Lexi shot in the
abductor's vehicle.

296
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:08,355
it is not Axel Vargas
behind the wheel.

297
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:12,125
Do-do you have any idea
who the guy was?

298
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,362
Actually, I was hoping you
could help us out there, John.

299
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,130
you have been running
that San Diego office

300
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,932
for a long time now.

301
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,168
You must have made some
enemies along the way?

302
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,769
Can you think
of anyone who...

303
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,871
who might want to
  up your girls

304
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,740
to hurt you
in some way?

305
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,342
 , I do not know. I...

306
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:30,677
A family member of someone
you recently put away.

307
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,946
Or someone who was recently
released from prison?

308
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,514
Something like that?

309
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,216
We-we just brought down
a biker gang

310
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:38,151
that killed a city supervisor.
that is good.

311
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:39,686
Have your lab send
that file over

312
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,021
right away, and
we will look into it.

313
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:43,357
In the meantime, I want
to take a look at that video.

314
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,259
If this is about me,

315
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,229
maybe I will recognize the guy.

316
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,001
Where are you taking us?

317
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,170
Please just let us go.

318
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,839
My sister's only 13.
She is just a kid.

319
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:01,074
You do not need both of us.
Just please, let her go!

320
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,210
You    !

321
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:07,080
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

322
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,117
- Lexi!
- No!

323
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:15,555
I am sorry you had
to see that, John.

324
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:18,592
Do you recognize him?

325
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,794
No.

326
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:25,132
What if they are dead already?

327
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,402
I mean, he had a knife.
he is already

328
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:29,870
killed one person today, right?

329
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,439
You should not even be
thinking like that.

330
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,541
Not when there is a chance
they are still alive.

331
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,243
we will work it
till we find them.

332
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,712
It looks like
Lexi was trying

333
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:39,880
to send this clip
to somebody. She entered

334
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:41,448
this phone number, but
it did not go through.

335
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,949
Well, it is a silent call
for help.

336
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,184
Whose number is that?

337
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,419
it is mine.

338
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:48,688
She was trying to send it to me.

339
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,057
You were not in her
contact list?

340
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,627
I guess not.

341
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:56,329
Lexi and I have not had much
of a relationship

342
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,132
since she moved here
to live with her mother.

343
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:00,534
Well, you were

344
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:02,936
the first person
she thought of to reach out to

345
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:04,204
when she was in trouble.

346
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:07,574
that is got to
mean something.

347
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,146
Okay, all right,
where are we?

348
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,615
Did you find out anything
about the motorcycle gang

349
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,517
that Nolan helped take down?

350
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,386
Yeah. Most of them
are in prison.

351
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:22,122
San Diego P.D. verified the
whereabouts of the others.

352
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,625
Is there anyone else who might
have had a grudge against Nolan?

353
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,427
Well, Nolands lab
just cracked a series

354
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,796
of Mexican cartel murders
along the border,

355
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:31,565
but he has not received
any threats lately.

356
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,767
No, I think if
somebody wanted to get

357
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,536
back at him, why would they come
all the way here to Vegas?

358
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,038
Right. All right,
all right, look,

359
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,273
maybe this has absolutely
nothing to do with him.

360
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,541
The guy's got

361
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,577
two beautiful daughters, right?
they are young,

362
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,812
they are attractive,
they are in the mall.

363
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:48,315
The mall is like a hunting
ground for   predators.

364
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:51,284
Maybe this was a...
a crime of opportunity.

365
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,220
Well, I looked at all
the surveillance video

366
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,454
from the mall.

367
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:56,323
care of and Lexi left
through the west doors,

368
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,391
but they were alone.
Okay, but

369
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,793
that does not mean

370
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,127
that the kidnapper was not
already following them, right?

371
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,829
I mean, he could have been
laying in wait outside,

372
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,598
and then forced them
into a car.

373
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,799
Hey.

374
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,834
I was looking through
Lexi's text messages,

375
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,903
and I found something
interesting.

376
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,938
Seems she has an admirer

377
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,375
who likes to send her
pictures of his... genitals.

378
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,744
I will take your word for it.

379
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,846
Well, she told the guy to
stop, the images kept coming.

380
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:22,716
When she threatened to share
the pics with the cops,

381
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,651
the perv wrote back,

382
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,654
"You  , you are
just like your mother."

383
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,189
He knows

384
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:29,956
Tori Nolan.

385
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,491
Did you run the number?

386
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:34,528
Yeah. Came back to a used car
salesman named Dennis Hayes.

387
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,996
let us bring him in.
Police are trying

388
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,364
to track him down.

389
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:39,933
In the meantime, Sara's going to
talk with Tori Nolan.

390
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,236
Please, let her go!
You    !

391
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:46,039
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

392
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,274
Lexi!

393
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,009
No!

394
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,810
Is that Dennis Hayes?

395
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,112
I am not sure.

396
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,481
I-I have only met him
a couple of times.

397
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,049
How do you know him?

398
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:59,386
He was a friend
of my ex-boyfriend.

399
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,388
Oh, my  .
Do you think he did this?

400
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,756
Do you think he took my girls?

401
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,357
that is what
we are trying to figure out.

402
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,161
Mrs. Nolan, we found
some pretty graphic photos

403
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,797
and texts that
Dennis sent to Lexi.

404
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,700
What was the nature
of their relationship?

405
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:15,335
She barely knew him.

406
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,871
He came to our house
for a party once.

407
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:25,312
Lexi was not feeling well,
and she went up to bed.

408
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:29,115
I decided to go check on her
about a half an hour later, and

409
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:33,086
she was passed out on the bed.

410
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:38,291
And Dennis was on top of her
trying to take her clothes off.

411
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:39,559
What did you do?
Well, I pulled him

412
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:40,794
off of her, and I told him

413
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,128
to get the   out of my house.

414
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,097
You called the police.

415
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,034
No, I did not.

416
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,836
Why not?

417
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,240
Because we had
been drinking.

418
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:58,011
And taking E.

419
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,450
Lexi wanted to try it, and...

420
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,752
I let her.

421
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:10,190
I did not want the cops
to find out.

422
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,626
I did not want them
to take her away from me.

423
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,195
You did not report
Dennis Hayes,

424
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,465
and now, he may have abducted
both of your daughters.

425
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,500
Do you have

426
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:23,770
any idea
where he could have taken them?

427
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:27,007
I wish I did.

428
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,697

Mr. Nolan...

430
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,399
You brought that monster
into our daughter's life.

431
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,418
And now he is taken her and care of!

432
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,986
I did not know.
I should never have let you

433
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:41,154
have custody of Lexi.

434
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:42,389
She did not want
to live with you.

435
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,557
Hey, your daughters are missing,
and this is not

436
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,726

let us just focus on bringing

437

Please, tell me
you got something.

442
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:11,951
As a matter of
fact, I do.

443
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,888
I have been analyzing the
video that Lexi took,

444
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,290
and from the dashboard,
I can tell that

445
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,693
the vehicle
they were abducted in was

446
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,294
a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban.

447
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:23,163
Does Dennis Hayes drive
one of those?

448
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,398
No, but I mean,
he is a used car salesman.

449
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,534
He has access
to all kinds of vehicles.

450
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,669
All right, I will call
the dealership,

451
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:32,405
and, a, I will see if they have
a '86 Suburban in inventory.

454
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,128
In the Dumpster.

455
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,964

accidentally threw out

Crushing blows causing massive
cerebral hemorrhaging.

530
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:29,963
And does the injury indicate
what type of weapon was used?

531
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,600
Her head was smashed into
a very hard, flat surface.

532
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,869
Okay. I found traces of stone

533
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,203
in the wound.

534
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:40,740
And the fingernail scratches

535
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:42,542
around the ligature
marks indicates

536
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:46,212
that she tried to get away.

537
00:26:46,214 --> 00:26:47,447
Any evidence of   assault?

538
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,250
No physical
findings. She had

539
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,118
consensual  
earlier in the day.

540
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,954
DNA can sort out
any multiple donors.

541
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:57,190
And what is that bite
on her shoulder?

542
00:26:57,192 --> 00:26:58,892
Is that a sting,
some type of insect?

543
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,326
Based on the redness

544
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,462
and the inflammation,
I think you are right.

545
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,400
Hey, do you think it could
be a scorpion sting?

546
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:09,636
I do not know. Why?
I found a piece

547
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:12,805
of exoskeleton on
the dead body in the restroom.

548
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:15,275
Same guy care of Nolan was with.

549
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,743
Will you extract some tissue

550
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:18,378
from around the sting
and have it analyzed

551
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,013
right away?
You got it.

552
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,249
<i>how is Nolan?</i>

553
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:25,351
he is holding it together
as best he can.

554
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,720
This is a guy who sees
dead bodies in autopsy

555
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:30,590
every day, but when it is
your own kid laying there...

556
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,892
Oof. I cannot even imagine.

557
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:36,229
John's a good guy.

558
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:37,664
He does not deserve this.

559
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,033
did not he send you

560
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:42,802
an autographed Chargers
jersey a few years ago?

561
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:44,571
Yeah, Dan Fouts.

562
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:46,005
One of the best
passing quarterbacks

563
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,974
in the NFL.
It was his attempt to

564
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,276
lure me to that
San Diego office.

565
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,780
You ever regret that?
Not taking the job out there?

566
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,448
No.

567
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,184
I mean, it was not a promotion
or anything like that.

568
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,723
Yeah, but the money
had to be better than here.

569
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:00,654
a, not really.

570
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:02,655
I mean, San Diegofs

571
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:04,724
an expensive town to live in.

572
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,560
Besides, this is my home.
I got all my friends here.

573
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,463
This is where my family is.

574
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,967
And look, the Chargers
got a good football team,

575
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:16,002
but they are no Dallas Cowboys.

576
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:17,403
Those are my boys.

577
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,272
Go Cowboys.

578
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,041
Hey, Russell.
Mm.

579
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:24,444
Doc confirmed that the
sting on Lexi Nolands

580
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:26,579
shoulder was from a scorpion.
Same type

581
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,048
as the exoskeleton that Nick found?
No.

582
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,584
This was not
a giant hairy scorpion.

583
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,953
The histopath report
identified chlorotoxin

584
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:35,221
and maurotoxin,

585
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:38,591
consistent with a
deathstalker scorpion.

586
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,928
They common to Nevathe?

587
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,630
Indigenous to Israel.

588
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:46,099
Well then how is she
stung by one of these?

589
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,900
It had to be intentional.

590
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:50,103
Some people keep them as
pets, which is crazy--

591
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,938
deathstalkers are
highly aggressive.

592
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:55,842
<i>When they sting their victims,</i>
<i>the venom rushes</i>

593
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:57,844
<i>into the bloodstream,</i>
<i>causing increased heartbeat,</i>

594
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,614
<i>blood pressure, and,</i>
<i>if enough venom is released,</i>

595
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,850
<i>convulsions and death.</i>

596
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:06,219
Well, now, doc said
that Lexi Nolan died

597
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:08,955
from blunt force traumom, right?
Yes, but I think

598
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,157
the scorpion sting may have
contributed to her death.

599
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,393
See, Lexi had cuts

600
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:15,795
on the bottom of her feet.
If she tried to run,

601
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,130
with that venom in her system,

602
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,364
she would not have
gotten very far.

603
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:20,500
Allowing her killer
to catch up to her.

604
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:22,802
So do we know if Dennis Hayes

605
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,370
has a thing for scorpions?

606
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,972
he is not our guy.

607
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,208
Police tracked him down
to a motel in Nebraska.

608
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,576
he is been there three days.

609
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,912
So we know that
whoever killed Lexi Nolan

610
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:35,748
had access to
a deathstalker scorpion.

611
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,418
And if they are
not native to Nevathe,

612
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,953
then where did the guy get one?

613
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:44,157
Hey, turns out there are
seven places in Nevathe

614
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,125
that sell
deathstalker scorpions.

615
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:48,261
Seven places too many,
if you ask me.

616
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,896
I guess some people
get a kick out of

617
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:51,197
owning something
that can   you.

618
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,499
Deathstalkers only live
two to six years,

619
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,134
so I got a list of everyone

620
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:57,203
who purchased one
from 2008

621
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:58,705
to now.

622
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:02,809
We cross-reference this
with everyone who drives

623
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:05,211
a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban,

624
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:06,612
and we might get our guy.

625
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:09,415
Great minds think alike.

626
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:15,788
Here--

627
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,258
Kieran Clark.
528 Cactus Ridge Lane.

628
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,181
LVPD.

629
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:46,052
Kieran Clark, LVPD.

630
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,620
Clear inside.

631
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,292
All clear.

632
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:55,695
Nobody's here.

633
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,897
That means no care of.

634
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,738
This is Clark's address,
but it does not look like

635
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,940
he lives here.

636
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:11,978
Terrariums.

637
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,546
A lot of them.

638
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,927
Oh! Oh,  .

639
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:34,167
Guess he is not just
into scorpions.

640
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,941
Hey, Morgan.

641
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,911
Check this out.

642
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:46,379
Stalker photos.

643
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:48,347
care of Nolan was only in town
for the past few days.

644
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:51,017
What, has he been
stalking her the whole time?

645
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,891
Wait a minute.

646
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,193
that is somebody else.

647
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,028
that is not care of Nolan.

648
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,262
Who is it, then?

649
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:04,864
Another victim?
I do not know.

650
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:08,034
But whoever she is...

651
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:10,203
she is a dead ringer for care of.

652
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,183
I already heard.

653
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,052
You did not find care of.

654
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:46,088
No. Not yet.

655
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,490
But we know who took her
and we know why.

656
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:50,359
A guy named
Kieran Clark.

657
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,794
There was a-a shrine
in that barn.

658
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:54,830
It seems as though
the suspect

659
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,498
has an obsession
with a young woman.

660
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,566
We have not identified her yet,

661
00:32:57,568 --> 00:33:00,302
but she looks
just like care of.

662
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:02,504
He took my two girls

663
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:05,073
because care of
reminded him of someone?

664
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,909
that is what it
looks like, yeah.

665
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,744
But... only a
matter of time...

666
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,712
Before we get care of back.

667
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,481
Is that what you are going to
try and sell me?

668
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:15,684
John, I am not trying
to sell you on-on anything here,

669
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,786
but I am sure as  
not ready to quit.

670
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,087
we are going to find her.

671
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:21,557
No doubt we will.

672
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,093
Just like we found...

673
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,129
Lexi.

674
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,335
I am sorry about Lexi.

675
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:38,273
But hey, you cannot just fold
and throw in now. Come on.

676
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,642
I am no tourist, Nick.

677
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,579
I have run a crime lab
for 17 years.

678
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,381
care of's been missing
for 24 hours,

679
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:49,818
and that lunatic
already killed Lexi.

680
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:55,357
You and I both know how
this thing's probably going to end.

681
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:58,327
I am not about to quit.

682
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,028
And you are not, either.

683
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,664
You hear me?

684
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,867
Hey, look at me.

685
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:10,038
I will find her.

686
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,808
Okay, what do we know
about Kieran Clark?

687
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,242
he is known
as the Bug Guy.

688
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,845
He goes around to schools
and kids' birthday parties,

689
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,047
educating them
about insects and reptiles.

690
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:21,049
it is terrifying
that he works around children.

691
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,552
And the young woman
in these photos,

692
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:24,987
the one he is
obviously obsessed with?

693
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,455
According to the police report,

694
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:27,657
her name is Jennifer DeMarcus.

695
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,224
She used to work
at a pet shop in Henderson.

696
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:30,158
that is where they met.

697
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,227
She had one date with Clark

698
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:34,029
before she realized
he was a head case,

699
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,897
and then she told him
that she was not interested.

700
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:38,266
Let me guess-- he would not
take no for an answer.

701
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:39,935
He kept coming
around the pet shop,

702
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,436
and then he started
parking his car

703
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:43,005
in front of Jennifer's
apartment at night.

704
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,906
She called the police
on him several times.

705
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,341
Did she get a
restraining order?

706
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:47,976
Left town.
Moved back to Georgia.

707
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,879
Put as much distance between her
and Clark as she could.

708
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,447
Clearly, he is still
obsessed with her.

709
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,149
So, what do you think?

710
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,584
Kieran goes to the mall,

711
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,786
<i>sees care of looking</i>
<i>very much like Jennifer,</i>

712
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,955
<i>and he decides to grab her.</i>

713
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:01,790
Except care of
was with Pete Corday,

714
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,226
so Clark had to get rid
of him first.

715
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:14,736
And by the time he was done
with Pete, care of was with Lexi,

716
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,538
so he had to take them both.
Right.

717
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,306
The stone particles

718
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:21,343
that Nick found in Lexi Nolands
head wound were coated.

719
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:25,080
I identified a mixture
of ethanol, alkylalkoxysilane

720
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,382
and isopropyl acetate.

721
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:28,450
Oxysilane?

722
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:30,819
That sounds like
a sealant of some kind.

723
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,788
Actually, it is an
impregnating sealant,

724
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,724
used to protect concrete
from water and staining--

725
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:38,193
a, primarily
walkways, driveways.

726
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:40,395
There was no evidence of
sealant in the Dumpster

727
00:35:40,397 --> 00:35:42,297
where Lexi's body was
found, which means

728
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:44,700
it had to come from where
she was actually murdered.

729
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,803
Lexi tried to escape.

730
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:51,707
<i>She was still feeling distress</i>
<i>from the scorpion sting.</i>

731
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,308
<i>Maybe she was near a driveway</i>

732
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,211
<i>when Kieran Clark</i>
<i>caught up to her</i>

733
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:58,246
<i>and smashed her head into it.</i>

734
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,052
The sealant in
Lexi's wound

735
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,788
was not entirely cured,
meaning that it was

736
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,191
probably applied
within the last couple of days.

737
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:10,492
Okay. All right.

738
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:12,594
let us do a search within
a five-mile radius

739
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,463
of where Lexi's body
was found.

740
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,964
we are looking for
somebody who recently

741
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,734
had their concrete
driveway sealed.

742
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,172
Hey.
Hi.

743
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,474
I heard you
got something.

744
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,676
Yeah. Lexi's body
was found right here.

745
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,912
Two miles away,
on Harvard Drive,

746
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:34,182
this house had their driveway
sealed on Wednesday.

747
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,518
Now, we know that when Lexi ran
she did not get very far,

748
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,919
so Clark's got to be
holding care of

749
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,421
somewhere nearby.

750
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:40,622
I should get out there.

751
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:42,457
Wait for backup.

752
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,626
I will.

753
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:59,841
♪ ♪

754
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,499
LVPD!

755
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:25,834
Get over here.

756
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:27,102
Kieran Clark!

757
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:29,671
No! Let me go!

758
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,707
Drop the knife.

759
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,342
do not come
any closer.

760
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,245
Put the knife down.

761
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,549
I will slit her throat.

762
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,418
Hey, me and you,
we can work this out.

763
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,320
But you do not need to hurt her.

764
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:48,356
What I need is
for you to leave.

765
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:50,826
Now, we both know that is not
going to happen.

766
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,861
Go!

767
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,397
I will   her.

768
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,801
I know about the girl
from the pet store.

769
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:01,536
Jennifer-- I mean, is not that
the girl you liked?

770
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,605
I love her.
Okay.

771
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:05,507
All right.

772
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,375
But she is not her.

773
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:10,712
Her name is care of Nolan.
She is 13 years old.

774
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:11,913
She is never done anything
to hurt you.

775
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,882
I know...

776
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:16,585
when you saw her at the mall,
you thought...

777
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:17,886
"that is Jennifer."

778
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:21,223
But take a closer look.

779
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,658
it is not her.

780
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,227
She is a child,
and she...

781
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:27,362
she needs to go home.

782
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,733
you are wrong.

783
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,368
She is mine.

784
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,670
Let her go.

785
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:36,938
I cannot let you take her.

786
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,616
it is okay.

787
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,584
it is all right. I am a
friend of your dathes.

788
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,453
Thank you.

789
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,993
it is going to be all right.

790
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,222
how is she doing?

791
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,790
Physically, she is okay.

792
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,459
She is been through
a   of an ordeal, but...

793
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:34,262
...she is alive because of you.

794
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:36,197
You never gave up.

795
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:39,834
Thank you for
bringing her back to me.

796
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,037
you are welcome.

797
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,974
You know, Nick...

798
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:49,611
I have been thinking
about the choices I made.

799
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,546
Working weekends and evenings.

800
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,949
Missing school plays,
soccer games.

801
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:56,384
Sometimes going days
without seeing my girls.

802
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,186
For years, I have been putting
other people's families

803
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,287
ahead of my own.

804
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,855
I do not want to do that anymore.

805
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:03,925
So, what are you saying?
you are going to hang it up?

806
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:06,194
Well, care of needs me.

807
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,462
Now more than ever.

808
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,398
It would be a big loss
for your crime lab.

809
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,901
Not with you there.

810
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:14,936
John, we have talked about this.
I have already got a job.

811
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,906
I am not asking you
to just join the team.

812
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:20,542
I am asking you to run it.

813
00:40:21,678 --> 00:40:24,379
You want me to take over
the crime lab in San Diego?

814
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,114
I know it would be
in good hands

815
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:28,016
with you at the helm.

816
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,789
that is a big job.

817
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,058
You do not have to answer me
right now.

818
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,095
Just promise me...
you will think about it.

819
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:47,906
Thank you, Nick.
