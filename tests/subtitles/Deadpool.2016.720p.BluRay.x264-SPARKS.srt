1
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,800
Kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:06,298
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:12,096
Okay, just, I have to keep my hands
on the wheel.

4
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:14,929
Excuse me.

5
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:17,838
Dopinder.

6
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,938
Pool. Dead.

7
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,568
Nice.

8
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,803
Smells good, no?

9
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,783
Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.

10
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,329
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.

11
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:34,446
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

12
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,734
But, Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

13
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:42,804
He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.

14
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:47,804
Dopinder, I'm starting to think
there's a reason I'm in this cab today.

15
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,536
Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?

16
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:54,416
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

17
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:57,306
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

18
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,310
So you gotta hold onto love...

19
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,049
tight!

20
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:05,052
And never let go.
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

21
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:06,344
- Got it?
- Yeah.

22
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,954
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

23
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,768
Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?

24
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,771
- Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
- Okay, enough.

25
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,732
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

26
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,542
It's bad.

27
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,737
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

28
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,739
That's because
it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

29
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,283
And I'm after someone on my naughty list.

30
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:31,912
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks, six days and...

31
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,352
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

32
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:38,251
And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?

33
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,691
This shit...

34
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:41,899
Boo!

35
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,924
They won't disappoint.

36
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,321
They'd better not.

37
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,782
And what about next month's shipment?

38
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,575
There won't be one.

39
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,215
You're not the only one with a war to win.

40
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,848
That won't do.

41
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,686
See, we've had this small disruption
to our supply chain...

42
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,734
We'd appreciate your patience.

43
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:31,237
Okay.

44
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:34,238
We'll deliver in full the following month.

45
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:38,794
Pleasure doing business with you.

46
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,459
Fucking mutant.

47
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,996
Ah, shit!

48
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,466
I forgot my ammo bag.

49
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,056
- Shall we turn back?
- No, no time.

50
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,002
Fuck it. I got this.

51
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:05,380
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.

52
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,190
Right here!

53
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,011
That's $27.50.

54
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,763
I never carry a wallet when I'm working.

55
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,283
Ruins the lines of my suit.

56
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,200
But, how about a crisp high five?

57
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:18,352
Okay.

58
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:19,702
Merry Christmas.

59
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,037
And a convivial Tuesday in April
to you too, Pool!

60
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,491
Shoop shooop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

61
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,534
You're packed and you're stacked
'specially in the back

62
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,329
Brother, wanna thank your mother
for a butt like that

63
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,790
Can I get some fries
with that shake-shake boobie?

64
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,042
If looks could kill you would be an uzi

65
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,602
You're a shotgun - bang!

66
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:48,632
Oh, hello. I know, right?

67
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:52,386
Whose balls did I have to fondle
to get my very own movie?

68
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:56,066
I can't tell you,
but it does rhyme with "Polverine."

69
00:06:56,323 --> 00:07:01,812
And let me tell you, he's got a nice pair
of smooth criminals down under.

70
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:06,066
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and...

71
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,836
Bad guys to kill.

72
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:15,507
Maximum effort.

73
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,349
Cock shot.

74
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,242
Rich Corinthian leather.

75
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,028
I'm looking for Francis!

76
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:41,865
Have you seen this man?

77
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,132
Yanky, yanky!

78
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,119
I've never said this, but don't swallow.

79
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,978
Shit.

80
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,615
Did I leave the stove on?

81
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,464
Now, breaking news.

82
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,384
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

83
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,667
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.

84
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:21,576
Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.

85
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:24,705
The assailant appears to be armed,
dangerous, and wearing...

86
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,225
- a red suit.
- A red suit.

87
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,083
Deadpool.

88
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,893
Negasonic! Come, we have mission.

89
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,214
Colossus, wait up.

90
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:37,634
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us...

91
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,886
but he'd rather act like a child.

92
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,431
A heavily-armed child.

93
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:46,226
When will he grow up
and see benefits of becoming X-Man?

94
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,156
Which benefits? The matching unitards?

95
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,313
The house that blows up every few years?

96
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,398
Please.

97
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,828
House blowing up builds character.

98
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,153
You ate breakfast, yes?

99
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:58,503
Breakfast is most important meal of day.

100
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:03,660
Here, protein bar. Good for bones.

101
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,100
Deadpool may try to break yours.

102
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:15,901
Get out of the way!

103
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:34,917
Hey!

104
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,394
Wait!

105
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,790
You may be wondering, "Why the red suit?"

106
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,810
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

107
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,061
This guy's got the right idea.

108
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,734
He wore the brown pants.

109
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,800
Fine! I only have 12 bullets...

110
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,510
so you're gonna have to share!

111
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,400
Let's count them down.

112
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:23,876
Shit.

113
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,637
Motherfucker!

114
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,060
10! Shit!

115
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:32,643
Nine. Fuck.

116
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:33,729
Eight.

117
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,269
Shit-fuck!

118
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,274
Bad Deadpool.

119
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,903
Seven. Good Deadpool.

120
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,684
Someone's not counting. Six.

121
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,497
Four.

122
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:39,872
Gotcha.

123
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,876
Right up Main Street.

124
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,033
Three, two!

125
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,013
Stupid! Worth it.

126
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,329
I'm touching myself tonight.

127
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,254
Francis!

128
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:21,865
Francis...

129
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,071
What the shit-biscuit!

130
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,881
Where you at, Francis?

131
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:37,847
You're not Francis.

132
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,319
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

133
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:01,940
You're probably thinking, "My boyfriend
said this was a superhero movie...

134
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,840
"but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kabab!"

135
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:10,416
Well, I may be super, but I'm no hero.

136
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,909
And, yeah, technically, this is a murder.

137
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,245
But some of the best love stories
start with a murder.

138
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:18,331
And that's exactly what this is.
A love story.

139
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,791
And to tell it right...

140
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:24,691
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeezed this ass into red spandex.

141
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:30,677
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

142
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:34,514
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

143
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:37,744
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant
who didn't order the fucking pie!

144
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,238
Then who placed the call?

145
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,120
I did!

146
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:44,867
Pineapple and olive?

147
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,278
Sweet and salty.

148
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,448
The fuck are you?
The fuck you doing in my crib...

149
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:52,468
Is it burnt crust?

150
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,089
God, I hope not.

151
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,536
Man, look, if this is
about that poker game.

152
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,872
I told Howie, I told him that...

153
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:02,876
Okay, look, just take whatever you want.

154
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,056
Thanks.

155
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:07,608
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

156
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:10,967
Jeremy, is it?

157
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,487
Wade. Wade Wilson.

158
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,556
That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer.

159
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,116
I'm not here for him.

160
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,082
I'm here for you.

161
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,563
Okay, wow, dodged a big-time
bullet on that one.

162
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,583
Not out of the woods yet.

163
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,485
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

164
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,487
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

165
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:32,823
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

166
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,658
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

167
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:37,008
I will shoot your fucking cat!

168
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:40,264
I don't really know what that means.
I don't have a cat.

169
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,347
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

170
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,588
Anyhoo, tell me something...

171
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:52,384
what situation isn't improved by pizza?

172
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,761
Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?

173
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,430
Getting that right? Orflosky?

174
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,820
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

175
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,268
Because she knows you.

176
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:05,772
Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys
who take a dime to beat a fella down.

177
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:08,734
And little Meghan, she's not made of money,
but lucky for her...

178
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,134
I got a soft spot.

179
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,670
- But I'm a...
- A stalker.

180
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,698
Threats hurt, Jer.

181
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:18,201
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

182
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,455
So keep away from Meghan.

183
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,414
Cool?

184
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,707
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,557
Then we're done.

186
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:27,127
Wait. We are?

187
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,897
Yeah. We're totally done.

188
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:30,964
You should’ve seen your face.

189
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:32,364
I didn't know what to do. I was so scared.

190
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,729
Soft spot, remember?

191
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,262
You even look
in her general direction again...

192
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:41,072
and you will learn in the worst of ways
that I have some hard spots too.

193
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,406
That came out wrong.

194
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:46,749
Or did it?

195
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:00,931
Meghan?

196
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,597
You've heard the last of Jeremy.
He's sorry.

197
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,273
No friggin' way.

198
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,726
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

199
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:19,262
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

200
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,181
Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad?

201
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,951
I give a guy a pavement facial,
it's because he's earned it.

202
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:25,908
Hey, wait!

203
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:28,647
You're my hero.

204
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,247
No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

205
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:35,416
Nope. Never will be.

206
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,296
Fuck you, Wade.

207
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:41,131
I'm just a bad guy
who gets paid to fuck up worse guys.

208
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,184
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

209
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:46,561
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

210
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,209
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...

211
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,962
except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.

212
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:55,048
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

213
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,978
Buck! Liefeld...

214
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,277
Hey, Wade!

215
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:01,282
Wade Wilson, patron saint of the pitiful.
What can I do for you?

216
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,072
I'd love a Blow Job.

217
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:04,558
Oh, God, me too.

218
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,658
The drink, moose knuckle. But first...

219
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,313
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money, all right?

220
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,190
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

221
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,233
Orlovsky.

222
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,234
Yeah, her.

223
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,594
You sure?

224
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,238
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

225
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,198
I bet you let the kid off easy, too.

226
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,159
He's not a bad kid, Weas.

227
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,577
Just a little light stalking.

228
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:25,078
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

229
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:27,039
I was traveling to exotic places...

230
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,139
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then...

231
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,481
Killing them.
Yeah, I've seen your Instagram.

232
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:36,173
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

233
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,758
That's classified.

234
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,093
They have a wonderful TGI Fridays.

235
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,429
All right, Kahlua, Baileys and...

236
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,764
whipped cream.

237
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:45,954
I give you a Blow Job.

238
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,768
Why do you make me make that?

239
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,603
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

240
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:53,106
Take that over to Buck, please, and tell him
it's from Boothe. Little foreplay.

241
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,442
Remind me what good will come of this?

242
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,527
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

243
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:58,167
Boothe!

244
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,113
- Easy, man.
- Hold up! Hold up!

245
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,213
What you want?

246
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,340
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

247
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,955
Come here, you fat fuck!

248
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,515
That's a new stool.

249
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,845
Stay the fuck down.

250
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,134
Whoa! Took his ass out!

251
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,095
All right, move. Move, move, move.

252
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,245
Buck, go rest.

253
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,862
Boothe got hit then went down.

254
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,330
Yeah, he's still breathing.

255
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,484
Nobody wins today.

256
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,152
Nice try, Wade.

257
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:42,823
You got me. I picked Boothe
in the dead pool. Who did you pick?

258
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,883
Yeah, Wade, about that...

259
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,183
No.

260
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:48,433
You did not bet on me to die.

261
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:54,846
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.

262
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,504
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.

263
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,798
And then dying. Like the city of Detroit.

264
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,676
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

265
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,010
I never win anything.

266
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,178
Whatever.

267
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:06,858
Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!

268
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,202
Domestic, nothing imported.

269
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,127
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

270
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,419
Tight.

271
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,049
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

272
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,553
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

273
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,178
I'd hit that.

274
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,272
Buck, you best apologize before...

275
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,752
Yeah, that.

276
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,462
Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf.

277
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,380
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.

278
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,591
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

279
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:43,941
Let go. Okay. Hey...

280
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,137
- Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry.
- I'm working on it.

281
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,197
Get out of here. Go. Go cast a spell.

282
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,201
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

283
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:54,793
Merchandise?

284
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,689
So you...

285
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,149
bump fuzzies for money?

286
00:20:59,249 --> 00:20:59,941
Yep.

287
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,234
Rough childhood?

288
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,319
Rougher than yours.

289
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:03,999
Daddy left before I was born.

290
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,169
Daddy left before I was conceived.

291
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,722
Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?

292
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,369
Where else do you put one out?

293
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,703
I was molested.

294
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,455
Me too. Uncle.

295
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,855
Uncles. They took turns.

296
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,710
I watched my own birthday party
through the keyhole of a locked closet...

297
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,128
which also happens to be my...

298
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:23,058
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

299
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,189
You had a dishwasher.

300
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,760
I didn't even know sleep.

301
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,110
It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags,
brownie mix and clown porn.

302
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,409
Who would do such a thing?

303
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:40,538
Hopefully you, later tonight?

304
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:48,296
Hey, what can I get for $275 and a...

305
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,159
a Yogurtland rewards card?

306
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,889
Baby, about 48 minutes
of whatever the fuck you want.

307
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,097
And a low-fat dessert.

308
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,395
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

309
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,864
It's time to put balls in holes.

310
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:12,414
You said whatever I want.

311
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
I get it.

312
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,018
You love skee ball.

313
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,353
Apparently more than you love vagina.

314
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,913
That's a tough call.

315
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,025
I just wanna get to know
the real you, you know.

316
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,965
Not the short-shorted, two-dimensional
sex object peddled by Hollywood.

317
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,089
Balls in holes.

318
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,206
Balls in holes.

319
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:31,825
Prepare to lose tragically.

320
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:32,993
Bring it, big man.

321
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:34,093
Okay.

322
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:44,813
The limited edition Voltron:
Defender of the Universe ring, por favor.

323
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,772
Okay. Here we go.

324
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,802
Had my eye on this sucker for a while.

325
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,679
And I will take the pencil eraser.

326
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,139
Okay.

327
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,975
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

328
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,407
And you can erase stuff...
written in pencil.

329
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,147
M'lady?

330
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,463
Well, I hate to break it to you...
but your 48 minutes are up.

331
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,695
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

332
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:13,295
FYI, five mini lion-bots come together
to form one super-bot, so...

333
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:16,703
Five mini lion-bots? Three minutes.

334
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:17,704
Deal.

335
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:20,104
What do we do with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

336
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:21,983
Cuddle?

337
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:27,813
How long can you keep this up?

338
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,113
All year?

339
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,665
Happy Valentine's Day.

340
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,862
Happy Chinese New Year.

341
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,302
Year of the Dog.

342
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,681
Relax.

343
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,352
And Happy International Women's Day.

344
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:09,019
No. No. No.

345
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:12,528
Happy Lent.

346
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:19,015
- Wade?
- Sorry.

347
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:20,445
Happy Halloween.

348
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,696
Happy Halloween.

349
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,171
Happy Thanksgiving.

350
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,383
I love you.

351
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,205
If your left leg is Thanksgiving...

352
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:46,808
and your right leg is Christmas...
can I visit you between the holidays?

353
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,558
That sweater is terrible.

354
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:53,216
But red looks good on you.

355
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:54,384
Red's your color.

356
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,244
Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.

357
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,305
Listen, I've been thinking...

358
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:01,743
- Really?
- ...about why we're so good together.

359
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,239
Why's that?

360
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,755
Your crazy matches my crazy. Big time.

361
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,880
And, we're like two jigsaw pieces,
you know, the weird curvy edges...

362
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,673
You put them together
and you can see the picture on top.

363
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:17,553
Right.

364
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,265
Wade...

365
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:22,454
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

366
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,064
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

367
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,234
Will you...

368
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,346
- stick it in my...
- Marry me?

369
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:35,357
Jinx?

370
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,345
Where were you hiding that?

371
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:39,455
Nowhere.

372
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,140
They say one month's salary. So...

373
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,183
You mean?

374
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:44,351
I do.

375
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:45,451
That's my line.

376
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,419
I love you, Wade Wilson.

377
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,526
You're supposed to... So that's a...

378
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:53,456
Yes!

379
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:55,958
Yes!

380
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,549
I feel just like a little girl.

381
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,165
What if I just held on and never let go?

382
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,805
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

383
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:12,311
Star Wars jokes.

384
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,981
Empire.

385
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,650
Jesus Christ.
It's like I made you in a computer.

386
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:23,989
Hey.

387
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,085
Perfect.

388
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:31,690
- Let's see.
- All right, wee break.

389
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,080
Shake it, yeah.

390
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,469
Here's the thing.

391
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,743
Life is an endless series
of train-wrecks...

392
00:26:42,843 --> 00:26:46,353
with only brief,
commercial-like breaks of happiness.

393
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,015
This had been
the ultimate commercial break.

394
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,672
Which meant it was time to return
to our regularly scheduled program.

395
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:56,522
What the...

396
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,779
Oh, my God. Wade?

397
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,323
You're clowning.

398
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,205
You're not clowning?

399
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:09,618
I sense clowns.

400
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:13,482
People react to news
of late-stage cancer differently.

401
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:18,132
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.

402
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,804
So what do we do?

403
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,636
Surely there is something we can do.

404
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:30,374
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

405
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,959
and there were all these
new experimental drugs from Germany.

406
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,309
Vanessa's already working on
Plan A, B, all the way through Z.

407
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:41,146
Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

408
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,198
Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.

409
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:45,347
Or the last.

410
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:46,890
Mr. Wilson...

411
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,410
Mr. Wilson?

412
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,115
Take your time to process this.

413
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:54,082
It's important not to do anything rash.

414
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:10,894
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

415
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:40,694
A hush falls over the crowd
as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson...

416
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:44,264
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

417
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,594
His form looks good.

418
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:53,509
And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.

419
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,376
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

420
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:58,726
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

421
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,231
Giving him the business.

422
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:02,735
Incoming!

423
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,609
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

424
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,621
Looking good, Francis. Well rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

425
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:19,165
Ringing any bells? No?

426
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,379
How about now?

427
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,554
Wade fucking Wilson.

428
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:35,290
Well, hello, gorgeous.

429
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,335
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

430
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:41,546
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

431
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,632
Yeah, time to undo
what you did to this butterface.

432
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,732
Please, you should thank me.
Apparently, I made you immortal.

433
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,637
I'm actually quite jealous.

434
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,987
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living, is it?

435
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:57,204
Now, I'm about to do to you what
Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s.

436
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,373
Dad?

437
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:08,422
I think we can all agree that shit just
went sideways in the most colossal way.

438
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:11,426
Well, maybe not the most.

439
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,681
This is my most prized possession.

440
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,249
Wham?

441
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,179
No, no, no. Wham!

442
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:23,188
Make It Big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

443
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:27,092
So, am I supposed to just smile
and wave you out the door?

444
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,719
Think of it like spring cleaning.

445
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,053
Only if spring was death.

446
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:34,123
God, if I had a nickel for every time
I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.

447
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,618
Sounds like you do.

448
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:41,356
Bernadette is not going anywhere,
because you're not going anywhere.

449
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:42,246
Drink.

450
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,360
You're right. Cancer is only in my liver,
lungs, prostate, and brain.

451
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,590
All things I can live without.

452
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:50,866
You belong here at home.

453
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:54,586
Surrounded by your Voltron
and your Bernadette, and your me.

454
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,389
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

455
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:07,319
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-opening-for-the-
Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

456
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:12,606
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

457
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,619
I want you to remember me.

458
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,935
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

459
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:20,825
Well, I wanna remember us.

460
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:22,898
I swear to God,
I will find you in the next life...

461
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:26,109
and I'm gonna boom-box Careless Whisper
outside your window.

462
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,629
Wham!

463
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:34,006
No one is boom-boxing shit. Okay?

464
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,975
We can fight this.

465
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,311
Besides, I just realized something.

466
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:49,274
You win. Your life is officially
way more fucked up than mine.

467
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,695
I love you.

468
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,504
Wade.

469
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:10,862
Weas.

470
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,448
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

471
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,617
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

472
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,327
How about three shots of Patrón?

473
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:21,123
Or how about Triticum aestivum,
wheatgrass.

474
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:22,541
Excellent for the immune system.

475
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,668
Jesus Christ. You sound like Vanessa.

476
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:25,877
Here, check it out.

477
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,381
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

478
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,231
I'm sure they're all FDA approved.

479
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,594
Chechnya. Isn't that where you go
to get cancer?

480
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,454
You got China and Central Mexico.

481
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,100
You know how they say "cancer" in Spanish?

482
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,240
No.

483
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,562
El Cáncer.

484
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,502
I could have guessed that.

485
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:47,357
Look how happy you look here.

486
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:51,457
Mind if I keep this? Put it up,
so I can remember when you looked alive.

487
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,864
At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.

488
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:56,616
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

489
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:58,296
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

490
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:03,707
And that guy over there
came in looking for you.

491
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,626
Real Grim Reaper type.

492
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,686
I don't know. Might further the plot.

493
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,717
Boothe.

494
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:14,897
Wade.

495
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,202
Mr. Wilson.

496
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,809
How can I help you?

497
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:25,562
Besides luring children into a panel van.

498
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:29,274
I understand you've recently
been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

499
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,442
Stalker alert.

500
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,712
It's my job. Recruitment.

501
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:35,882
I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.

502
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,242
But you're a fighter. Special Forces.

503
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:41,682
41 confirmed kills.

504
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,580
One every seven weeks.

505
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Same rate most folks get a haircut.

506
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:47,985
It's to wash the taste out.

507
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:51,421
It's tough to forget being so impressive.

508
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:55,550
And now you spend your days
sticking up for the little people...

509
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,190
People change. What do you want?

510
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,609
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

511
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,244
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

512
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,960
And what's more, give you abilities
most men only dream of?

513
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:18,657
I'd say that you sound like an infomercial,
but not a good one, like Slap Chop.

514
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,325
More Shake Weight-y.

515
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,370
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.

516
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,580
We won't just make you better.

517
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,640
We will make you better than better.

518
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:30,944
A superhero.

519
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:36,269
Look, Agent Smith, I tried
the hero business and it left a mark.

520
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,363
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

521
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,620
Shit. We're within 500 yards of a school,
so you may wanna...

522
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:50,831
His drink's on him.

523
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,253
What did he say?

524
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,492
Hey, what's going on?

525
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,988
Hey. Sorry.

526
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,449
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

527
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,497
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

528
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:44,433
Hey, they've made three of those movies.

529
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:48,597
At some point you have to wonder
if he's just a bad parent.

530
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:06,606
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you...

531
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,870
but what it does to the people you love.

532
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,813
Who knew if this guy could save my life...

533
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:15,463
but I knew there was only
one way that I could save hers.

534
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,878
Isn't that what superheroes do?

535
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:38,266
Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing.

536
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,093
Pro: They pull down a gaggle of ass.

537
00:36:43,193 --> 00:36:44,511
Local dry cleaning discounts.

538
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:48,598
Lucrative film deals, both origin stories
and larger ensemble team movies.

539
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:51,810
Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.

540
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,562
You know, I can hear you.

541
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:56,773
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

542
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:58,583
Stay right here.

543
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:01,039
You've been warned before, Deadpool.

544
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:04,906
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

545
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,159
You will both be coming with us.

546
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:11,121
Look, Colossus, I don't have time for the
goody two-shoes bullshit right now!

547
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:13,061
And you are?

548
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,460
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

549
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,963
Negasonic Teenage... What the shit?

550
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,813
That's the coolest name ever!

551
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,927
So, what, you're like, his sidekick?

552
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,471
No. Trainee.

553
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:28,972
Let me guess.

554
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,516
X-Men left you behind on what?
Shit detail?

555
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,684
What does that make you?

556
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,145
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

557
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:36,505
Can we trade names?

558
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:38,106
Can we go?

559
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,525
Look! I'm a teenage girl.

560
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,778
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

561
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:45,030
I'm all about long sullen silences...

562
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,590
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

563
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:52,329
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

564
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,969
or mean comment? Go on.

565
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:57,524
You got me in a box here.

566
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,462
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

567
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:01,963
Please, come quietly.

568
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,299
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

569
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,342
That's not nice.

570
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:06,942
You're really gonna fuck this up for me?

571
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:11,640
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

572
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,280
He's pure evil.

573
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,949
Besides... nobody's getting hurt.

574
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:25,487
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

575
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,699
Wade, you are better than this.

576
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:32,244
- Join us. Use your powers for good.
- Heads up.

577
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,704
Be a superhero.

578
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:34,663
Listen!

579
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:37,103
The day I decide to become
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

580
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:40,502
who rooms with a bunch of other
little whiners at the Neverland mansion...

581
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:45,424
of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

582
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,284
on that day...

583
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,511
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

584
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:52,055
But until then,
I'mma do what I came here to do.

585
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,850
Either that or slap the bitch outta you!

586
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,143
- Wade...
- Hey.

587
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,394
Zip it, Sinéad!

588
00:38:57,494 --> 00:38:58,562
Hey, douche-pool!

589
00:38:58,662 --> 00:38:59,872
And I hope you're watching...

590
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,376
Quite unfortunate.

591
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:12,006
That does it!

592
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:17,758
Canada!

593
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,125
That's not good.

594
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,251
Wade, please.

595
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:22,351
Cock shot!

596
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:25,922
Your poor wife.

597
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,822
You really should stop.

598
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,783
All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.

599
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:40,604
I promise this gets worse
for you, big boy!

600
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:41,874
This is embarrassing.

601
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:44,422
Please, stay down.

602
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,903
You ever hear of the one-legged man
in the ass-kicking contest?

603
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:49,404
Do you have off switch?

604
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,240
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.
Or is that the on switch?

605
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,220
Enough!

606
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,846
Let us go talk to the Professor.

607
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:07,089
McAvoy or Stewart?

608
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:09,399
These timelines are so confusing.

609
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:13,345
"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!"

610
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,995
You will recover, Wade.

611
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,910
You always do.

612
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:24,831
You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.

613
00:40:28,585 --> 00:40:29,695
Oh, my God.

614
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:30,845
Nasty.

615
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,045
There's the money shot, baby.

616
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,470
Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.

617
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:51,817
Rock, meet bottom.

618
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:55,317
And when life ends up
breathtakingly fucked...

619
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,766
you can generally trace it back
to one big, bad decision.

620
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:03,061
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.

621
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,211
This? Well, this was mine.

622
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:08,208
Mr. Wilson.

623
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:14,072
Nothing warms my heart more
than a change of someone else's.

624
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,882
You finally hit "fuck it."

625
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,050
Just promise you'll do right by me.

626
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,663
So I can do right by someone else.

627
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:22,933
Of course.

628
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,432
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

629
00:41:26,726 --> 00:41:28,226
Or animated.

630
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,784
Move it! Keep moving.

631
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:50,545
This place seems sanitary.

632
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:53,543
My first request is warmer hands.

633
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:57,377
And, Jesus, a warmer table.

634
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,795
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

635
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:02,966
I'm thinking "pork and beans."

636
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:08,477
Easy.

637
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:12,769
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

638
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,945
I'm calling wang.

639
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,070
What's up with the matches?

640
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:23,072
Oral fixation or just a big Stallone fan?

641
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,908
Patience, Angel.

642
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,522
All in good time.

643
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:30,542
Are you here for the turndown service,
or what?

644
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,318
We have another talker.

645
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:35,195
I'm just excited about my first day
at superhero camp.

646
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,455
Shut the fuck up.

647
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,761
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

648
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,810
I manage this workshop.

649
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,127
My welcome speech used to be
full of euphemisms like...

650
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:53,797
"This may hurt a little."
"This may cause you some discomfort."

651
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:56,133
But I've grown blunt.

652
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:58,802
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

653
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:02,514
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

654
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:05,954
into men of extraordinary abilities.

655
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:10,827
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly...

656
00:43:11,748 --> 00:43:12,578
Wrong.

657
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,340
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

658
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:21,507
For it to work we need to subject
you to extreme stress.

659
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:30,272
You've heard that whole "make
an omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

660
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:32,437
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

661
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:36,153
I was a patient here
once myself, you know.

662
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,190
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

663
00:43:39,526 --> 00:43:42,356
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

664
00:43:42,696 --> 00:43:46,696
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.

665
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,160
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

666
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:55,712
And, in fact, I no longer feel anything.

667
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:07,007
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:09,064
You have something in your teeth.

669
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:12,125
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

670
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:15,135
A little nugget of romaine lettuce
or something.

671
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:19,567
It's been bothering me for a long time.

672
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,066
Made you look.

673
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,764
Is Ajax your actual name?
Because it sounds suspiciously made up.

674
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:26,932
What is it really?

675
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:29,393
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

676
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:31,083
Mitch? The Rickster?

677
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:33,255
Is it Basil Fawlty?

678
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,080
Joke away.

679
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,420
One thing that never survives this place
is a sense of humor.

680
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,153
We'll see about that.

681
00:44:40,253 --> 00:44:41,593
I suppose we will.

682
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:44,449
He's all yours.

683
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:45,759
Come on.

684
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:49,389
You're gonna leave me all alone here
with less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?

685
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:55,794
This is how it's going to work.

686
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:58,904
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum...

687
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:02,033
so we're going to have to make you suffer.

688
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:08,607
If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate
and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

689
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:15,751
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you...

690
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:20,292
in new and different ways,
each more painful than the last...

691
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,303
until you finally mutate.

692
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,135
Or die.

693
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,543
You mean like a bucket list?

694
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:38,879
Like a fuck-it list.

695
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:41,649
I'd really like to light a spliff
off the Olympic torch.

696
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:44,051
Pass it to me right after.

697
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:50,111
Let's not forget naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

698
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:54,288
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

699
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:57,656
Finally, giving Meredith Baxter-Birney
a Dutch oven.

700
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:01,076
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

701
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:09,175
Making banana pancakes for my kids.

702
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:14,636
Vanessa.

703
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,462
I wanna see Vanessa.

704
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:21,922
You're lovely.

705
00:46:22,022 --> 00:46:25,384
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'm touched.

706
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:26,551
We were just joking.

707
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,951
No, no. It's okay.

708
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,700
I encourage distractions.

709
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,768
Wouldn't want you giving up on us,
now would we?

710
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,698
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

711
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,981
How tough can he be...

712
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:43,001
with a name like Francis?

713
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:44,715
Francis?

714
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:46,423
That's his legal name.

715
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:50,507
He got "Ajax" from the dish soap.

716
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:56,142
F-R-A-N-C-I...

717
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,970
Oops!

718
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:02,648
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

719
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,925
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

720
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,385
You are so relentlessly annoying.

721
00:47:08,485 --> 00:47:09,469
Thanks.

722
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:10,762
Never heard that before.

723
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:14,057
Why don't you do us all a favor
and shut the fuck up?

724
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:16,157
Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

725
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:19,646
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

726
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:22,941
See, here's the problem
with round-the-clock torture...

727
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:26,001
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

728
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,970
Is that what you think?

729
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:38,773
If this doesn't unlock your mutation,
then, well...

730
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,889
nothing will.

731
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:44,254
Now, what we're going to do is lower
the oxygen concentration in the air...

732
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,984
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

733
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:50,444
If your brainwaves slow,
meaning you're about to pass out...

734
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:52,241
then we'll turn up the O2.

735
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,639
If your heart rate slows...

736
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,392
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

737
00:47:57,492 --> 00:47:58,872
we'll turn it back down.

738
00:47:59,494 --> 00:48:03,164
And that's where we'll leave you.
Right there.

739
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,776
And I thought you guys were dicks before.

740
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:08,286
You know the funniest part of this?

741
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:11,415
You still think we're making you
a superhero.

742
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:15,717
You. A dishonorable discharge.

743
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,510
Hip-deep in hookers.

744
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:20,852
You're nothing.

745
00:48:21,808 --> 00:48:23,268
Little secret, Wade.

746
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:28,192
This workshop doesn't make superheroes,
we make super-slaves.

747
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:33,034
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

748
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,200
Who knows what they'll have you doing?

749
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:39,491
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

750
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:44,501
Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.

751
00:48:44,998 --> 00:48:47,458
What the fuck is wrong with you?

752
00:48:52,714 --> 00:48:55,492
You're never going home after this.

753
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,802
Now there's a brave face.

754
00:48:58,845 --> 00:49:00,385
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

755
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:06,644
Seriously, you actually have something
in your teeth now.

756
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:09,943
Enjoy your weekend.

757
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:11,967
"Weekend"? Back up.

758
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,277
Weekend?

759
00:49:54,985 --> 00:49:57,012
Did I say this was a love story?

760
00:49:57,112 --> 00:49:59,572
No, it's a horror movie.

761
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:18,158
Fucking hell.

762
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:21,453
Looks like someone lost his shot
at Homecoming King.

763
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:23,580
What have you done to me?

764
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,000
I've merely raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

765
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,230
You sadistic fuck!

766
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:31,436
I've cured you, Wade.

767
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:33,902
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.

768
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:37,785
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

769
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:41,609
Yeah, I've seen similar
side effects before.

770
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:43,948
I could cure them...

771
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:49,207
but where's the fun in that?

772
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:54,091
Now, I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade.

773
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,839
Not because I need to.

774
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:03,512
Because I want to.

775
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:19,136
Oh, well.

776
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,446
Go ahead.

777
00:51:23,657 --> 00:51:25,487
You smell like shit.

778
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:29,827
Motherfucker.

779
00:51:30,747 --> 00:51:32,667
It's all right, it's all right.

780
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,500
I think we owe him that one, yeah?

781
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:38,132
You take off. Go on.

782
00:51:38,922 --> 00:51:40,262
Off you go.

783
00:51:51,268 --> 00:51:52,848
Quick question.

784
00:51:55,147 --> 00:51:57,187
What's my name?

785
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:04,276
Didn't think so.

786
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:08,868
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

787
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:06,720
You don't want to kill me.

788
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,070
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

789
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:07,376
What's my name?

790
00:55:13,553 --> 00:55:14,723
Wade.

791
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,120
I didn't just get the cure to el cáncer...

792
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:29,296
I got the cure to el everything.

793
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,160
But there was only one thing...

794
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,890
that really mattered.

795
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,383
Come on, let's go.

796
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:15,474
Oh, that must hurt.

797
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:17,928
Thank you so much.

798
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:32,050
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

799
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,510
Look at his face.

800
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,929
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

801
00:57:36,029 --> 00:57:37,097
Honey, don't stare.

802
00:57:37,197 --> 00:57:38,357
Freak.

803
00:57:58,718 --> 00:58:02,058
No way. I'm not making her life
as ugly as mine.

804
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:04,833
Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.

805
00:58:04,933 --> 00:58:06,209
Bullshit!

806
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:09,504
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

807
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:12,154
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

808
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:14,902
Do you like what you see?

809
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:16,322
No.

810
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,780
You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

811
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:21,933
Yeah.

812
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:24,061
Not gently. Like it was hate-fucking.

813
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:26,021
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

814
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:29,691
and that was the only catharsis that
they could find without violence.

815
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:32,319
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

816
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:35,072
is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

817
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,032
And he's gone. Poof!

818
00:58:37,132 --> 00:58:38,784
Yeah, well you gotta do something
to remedy this...

819
00:58:38,884 --> 00:58:41,870
because as of now,
you only have one course of action.

820
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,163
Damn straight.

821
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:45,082
- Find Francis.
- Star in horror films.

822
00:58:45,182 --> 00:58:46,083
What?

823
00:58:46,183 --> 00:58:48,335
Star in your own horror films.

824
00:58:48,435 --> 00:58:52,275
Because you look like Freddy Krueger
face-fucked a topographical map of Utah.

825
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:54,800
Here's what I'm actually gonna do.

826
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,511
I'm gonna work through his crew
until somebody gives up Francis...

827
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:59,930
force him to fix this,
then put a bullet in his skull...

828
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,640
and fuck the brain hole.

829
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,810
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

830
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,062
But the douchebag does
think you're dead, right?

831
00:59:07,162 --> 00:59:07,813
Yeah.

832
00:59:07,913 --> 00:59:09,731
That's good. You should keep it that way.

833
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:11,441
What, like, wear a mask?

834
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,501
Yes. A very thick mask. All the time.

835
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:16,196
I am sorry...

836
00:59:16,296 --> 00:59:18,865
you are haunting.

837
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:20,826
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.

838
00:59:20,926 --> 00:59:22,244
Like a testicle with teeth.

839
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:24,037
You will die alone.

840
00:59:24,137 --> 00:59:25,757
I mean, if you could die.

841
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,291
Ideally, for others' sake.

842
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:29,641
That'll do.

843
00:59:29,935 --> 00:59:31,670
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

844
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,650
like Wade the Wisecracker...

845
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:37,194
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

846
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:39,068
Shit.

847
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:40,743
What?

848
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:43,515
I put all my money on you and now...

849
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:45,142
I just realized I'm never gonna win the...

850
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:46,122
Dead pool.

851
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:52,422
Captain Deadpool.

852
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:55,360
No, just...

853
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,154
- Just Deadpool, yeah.
- Just Deadpool.

854
00:59:57,254 --> 00:59:59,214
To you, Mr. Pool.

855
00:59:59,506 --> 01:00:02,006
Deadpool.
That sounds like a fucking franchise.

856
01:00:16,606 --> 01:00:18,686
This shit's gonna have nuts in it.

857
01:00:19,776 --> 01:00:20,776
Where's Francis?

858
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,711
Where's Francis?

859
01:00:44,885 --> 01:00:46,805
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

860
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:51,058
Or wear red. Dumbass.

861
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:11,245
Don't make me ask twice.

862
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:13,939
Where...

863
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:16,169
is Francis?

864
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,402
He made me ask twice.

865
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:20,502
Is the mask muffling my voice?

866
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,760
Where's Francis?

867
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:31,217
Where the fuck is Francis?

868
01:01:39,898 --> 01:01:43,218
You're about to be killed by a Zamboni.

869
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:44,528
Where's Francis?

870
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:47,066
No! Please!

871
01:01:47,697 --> 01:01:51,157
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

872
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:54,331
You little spider monkey!

873
01:01:57,415 --> 01:02:00,875
Where... is... Francis?

874
01:02:02,045 --> 01:02:03,238
This is confusing.

875
01:02:03,338 --> 01:02:06,241
Is it sexist to hit you?
Is it more sexist to not hit you?

876
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:08,641
I mean, the line gets real... blurry.

877
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:10,930
Where is Francis?

878
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:15,774
Tell me where your fucking boss is
or you're gonna die!

879
01:02:16,393 --> 01:02:18,023
In five minutes!

880
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:29,915
Don't hesitate to call me.

881
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:47,717
Nice to see you, Jared.

882
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:51,684
I'll take the footlong... fully loaded.

883
01:03:07,277 --> 01:03:08,845
41 confirmed kills.

884
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:11,355
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

885
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:13,405
Mr. Wilson?

886
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:17,372
You're looking very alive.

887
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:19,255
Only on the outside.

888
01:03:19,915 --> 01:03:22,776
- This is not going to end well for me, is it?
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.

889
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:23,985
Where's your boss?

890
01:03:24,085 --> 01:03:25,705
I can tell you exactly...

891
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:29,302
Oh, you'll tell me, but first...

892
01:03:29,883 --> 01:03:32,119
You might wanna look away for this.

893
01:03:32,219 --> 01:03:33,469
Now this little piggy went to...

894
01:03:35,597 --> 01:03:37,887
Thank you, Agent Smith.

895
01:03:41,478 --> 01:03:42,228
Taxi!

896
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,230
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

897
01:03:48,235 --> 01:03:49,615
And we all know how this turned out.

898
01:03:52,572 --> 01:03:54,782
Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.

899
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:04,579
There. All caught up.

900
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:14,429
We're here.

901
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:18,425
Sorry about bleeding in all your garbage.

902
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:26,768
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

903
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:31,428
Some kinds of anger can't be managed...

904
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:36,618
like the kind where your year-long plan ends
with the wrong guy getting dismembered!

905
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:41,794
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

906
01:04:42,622 --> 01:04:46,882
And I share that home with someone you've met,
the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al.

907
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:48,844
God, I miss cocaine.

908
01:04:49,463 --> 01:04:50,173
Her.

909
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:53,878
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

910
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:56,684
That's like 16 walls.

911
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:02,584
She's like Robin to my Batman,
except she's old, and black, and blind.

912
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:04,354
And I think she's in love with me.

913
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:08,191
Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too.

914
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Al?

915
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,870
Morning, sleepyhead.

916
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:26,608
It smells like old lady pants in here.

917
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,610
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

918
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,300
But you're no lady.

919
01:05:31,463 --> 01:05:33,133
So comfy.

920
01:05:33,882 --> 01:05:36,868
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in Crocs.

921
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:38,412
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

922
01:05:38,512 --> 01:05:39,472
Yes, I know.

923
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:42,624
Downside of being blind...

924
01:05:42,724 --> 01:05:44,894
I hear everything in this duplex.

925
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:48,422
Sit on a stick.

926
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:49,464
Bactin?

927
01:05:49,564 --> 01:05:53,654
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

928
01:05:54,861 --> 01:05:58,640
How's that Kullen coming along?
IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.

929
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,643
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

930
01:06:01,743 --> 01:06:03,623
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

931
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:06,857
Please. Anything's an improvement
over the Hurdal.

932
01:06:06,957 --> 01:06:10,457
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

933
01:06:11,586 --> 01:06:13,876
No, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

934
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:15,032
Screw, please.

935
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:16,450
Here? Now? Just kidding.

936
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,701
I know it's been decades.

937
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:18,931
You'd be surprised.

938
01:06:19,636 --> 01:06:20,716
Pretty grossed out.

939
01:06:22,722 --> 01:06:25,142
Ta... Da.

940
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:34,069
I wish I never heard of Craigslist.

941
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:37,054
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,
blind to life's imperfections.

942
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:38,221
"Must be good with hands."

943
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:40,515
Or would you rather
I build the IKEA, and you pay rent?

944
01:06:40,615 --> 01:06:42,485
Why such a douche this morning?

945
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:44,311
Let's recap.

946
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:46,688
The cock thistle that turned me
into this freak...

947
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:48,408
slipped through my arms today...

948
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,293
Arm.

949
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:54,821
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super sexy ex back...

950
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:57,157
and prevent this shit
from happening to someone else.

951
01:06:57,257 --> 01:07:01,007
So, yeah, today was about as much fun
as a sandpaper dildo.

952
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:04,469
# driveby.

953
01:07:21,948 --> 01:07:23,948
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

954
01:07:26,286 --> 01:07:28,156
Fucking Wade Wilson.

955
01:07:29,122 --> 01:07:31,462
Suppose I'd wear a mask, too
if I had a face like that.

956
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,665
I only wish I healed the same.

957
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:40,367
Still, we'll put him out of our misery.

958
01:07:40,467 --> 01:07:41,717
On our terms.

959
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:43,885
Right. And when he heals?

960
01:07:44,888 --> 01:07:45,956
He can't.

961
01:07:46,056 --> 01:07:48,583
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

962
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:52,653
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

963
01:07:54,064 --> 01:07:55,484
I like a challenge.

964
01:07:56,817 --> 01:07:58,927
But he's bad for business.

965
01:07:59,027 --> 01:08:00,737
Now let's go find him.

966
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,560
Tylenol PM?

967
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,160
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

968
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:11,940
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

969
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,000
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

970
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:20,919
But I appreciate the gesture.

971
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:26,246
Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?

972
01:08:26,346 --> 01:08:28,096
About the size of a KFC spork.

973
01:08:30,267 --> 01:08:32,419
I get why you're so pissy...

974
01:08:32,519 --> 01:08:35,464
but your mood's never gonna brighten
till you find this woman...

975
01:08:35,564 --> 01:08:36,923
and tell her how you feel.

976
01:08:37,023 --> 01:08:40,343
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo?
She wouldn't have me.

977
01:08:40,443 --> 01:08:42,095
If you could see me, you'd understand.

978
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:43,263
Looks aren't everything.

979
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:44,431
Looks are everything.

980
01:08:44,531 --> 01:08:46,600
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

981
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,700
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.

982
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,314
Think Ryan Reynolds got this far
on his superior acting method?

983
01:08:52,414 --> 01:08:53,774
Love is blind, Wade.

984
01:08:53,874 --> 01:08:54,544
No.

985
01:08:55,876 --> 01:08:57,126
You're blind.

986
01:08:57,794 --> 01:09:00,655
So, you're just gonna lie there
and whimper?

987
01:09:00,755 --> 01:09:02,783
No, I'm gonna wait till this arm
plows through puberty...

988
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:04,883
and then I'm gonna come up
with a whole new Christmas Day plan.

989
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:08,472
In the meantime,
you might wanna leave the room.

990
01:09:09,139 --> 01:09:11,559
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

991
01:09:12,893 --> 01:09:15,603
Go, go, go.

992
01:09:16,146 --> 01:09:19,049
So, the doctor says, "The bad news is
you don't have that long to live."

993
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:20,675
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

994
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:22,636
The doctor says, "Five."

995
01:09:22,736 --> 01:09:24,304
The guy says, "Five what?"

996
01:09:24,404 --> 01:09:28,284
The doctor says, "Four, three, two..."

997
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:36,997
Can I help you ladies?

998
01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:40,746
I do hope so.

999
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:49,096
I heard you might be able to point me
in the direction of a friend of mine.

1000
01:09:49,638 --> 01:09:50,638
Name of Wade Wilson.

1001
01:09:52,182 --> 01:09:53,250
Sorry.

1002
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,930
I don't know the name.

1003
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:04,605
Hey, you're not supposed to be
behind the bar.

1004
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:10,183
I've seen this girl.

1005
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:12,793
This must be Vanessa.
I've heard so much about you.

1006
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,291
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around.

1007
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:22,456
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1008
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,574
Easy, Angel.

1009
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:27,054
Put the little man down.

1010
01:10:28,635 --> 01:10:30,385
We have everything we need now.

1011
01:10:30,804 --> 01:10:31,854
You sure?

1012
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:35,584
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1013
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:38,354
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

1014
01:10:42,023 --> 01:10:43,733
Thanks for having my back, guys.

1015
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:53,028
Wade, we have a fucking problem.
And by "we," I mean "you."

1016
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,580
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1017
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,899
Is there a word for half afraid,
half angry?

1018
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:01,068
Yeah, "afrangry," I guess.

1019
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:02,903
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1020
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:04,003
Fuck me!

1021
01:11:04,337 --> 01:11:06,257
Maybe not start with that.

1022
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:15,415
Hey, coming onto our stage right now...

1023
01:11:15,515 --> 01:11:17,675
give it up for Chastity!

1024
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:23,799
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1025
01:11:23,899 --> 01:11:25,967
Better find her fast before numbnuts does.

1026
01:11:26,067 --> 01:11:27,511
How do you know she's in here?

1027
01:11:27,611 --> 01:11:30,741
Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.

1028
01:11:55,722 --> 01:11:59,232
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time...

1029
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,230
Especially from this angle.

1030
01:12:25,752 --> 01:12:29,762
You can't buy love,
but you can rent it for three minutes.

1031
01:12:32,801 --> 01:12:35,471
You weak motherfucker!

1032
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:37,263
Come on!

1033
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:41,773
Come on, get it together.
This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa.

1034
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:47,269
Here we go.

1035
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,440
Maximum effort.

1036
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,120
Vanessa.

1037
01:12:58,618 --> 01:13:02,788
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about an old boyfriend.

1038
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,230
I knew it was you.

1039
01:13:33,069 --> 01:13:34,989
The weird, curvy edges.

1040
01:13:36,573 --> 01:13:38,413
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1041
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:50,342
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

1042
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:00,886
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1043
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:04,388
I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

1044
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,114
Motherfucker!

1045
01:14:34,214 --> 01:14:36,491
- Wait, wait. Let's... Just...
- Cock juggling...

1046
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:38,452
- We can talk about what we're gonna...
- Jiminy! Fuck face!

1047
01:14:38,552 --> 01:14:39,786
Okay, or you can hit that.

1048
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:41,663
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fuck! Fuck!

1049
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:44,433
- No, no. All right. Hey!
- Fuck! Fuck!

1050
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:45,931
- Fuck!
- Hey.

1051
01:14:46,977 --> 01:14:49,004
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1052
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:50,380
Okay. I think that’s a good start.

1053
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,507
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking...

1054
01:14:52,607 --> 01:14:53,550
Wait.

1055
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,093
- Find it! Find it.
- What?

1056
01:14:55,193 --> 01:14:56,613
- I'm gonna get angry.
- Okay. All right.

1057
01:14:57,028 --> 01:14:58,764
All right. Okay. All right.

1058
01:14:58,864 --> 01:15:00,140
Here. This is Vanessa.

1059
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,225
- What?
- No, wait. It's Francis.

1060
01:15:02,325 --> 01:15:03,945
He wants you to come to him.

1061
01:15:04,244 --> 01:15:06,414
- What is that?
- That's the shit emoji.

1062
01:15:06,788 --> 01:15:08,857
You know, it's the turd
with the smiling face and the eyes?

1063
01:15:08,957 --> 01:15:11,287
I thought it was chocolate yogurt
for so long.

1064
01:15:12,002 --> 01:15:13,153
I need guns.

1065
01:15:13,253 --> 01:15:14,363
Okay, which ones?

1066
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,530
I need all the guns!

1067
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,840
All right. Okay.

1068
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:38,987
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1069
01:15:39,946 --> 01:15:41,986
We all know what I can do with 12.

1070
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,559
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap!

1071
01:15:44,659 --> 01:15:45,739
We're downrange.

1072
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:50,754
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the Börje, but this is holding my interest.

1073
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:54,695
I told you, we're going with the Urvaj,
not the Börje.

1074
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:56,738
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1075
01:15:56,838 --> 01:15:59,574
Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.

1076
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:01,434
Nah. Come on. Let's go. Cough it up.

1077
01:16:01,802 --> 01:16:03,302
Up, up, up.

1078
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:05,789
Down, down, down.

1079
01:16:05,889 --> 01:16:06,599
Fuck you.

1080
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:11,435
.45 cal. I like it.

1081
01:16:13,605 --> 01:16:14,865
Wade...

1082
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:18,776
I'd go with you, but I don't want to.

1083
01:16:23,323 --> 01:16:24,493
Listen, Al...

1084
01:16:25,575 --> 01:16:30,745
if I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

1085
01:16:31,665 --> 01:16:36,737
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment...

1086
01:16:36,837 --> 01:16:39,627
right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.

1087
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:46,427
You wanna get fucked up?

1088
01:16:56,523 --> 01:16:58,023
Put her down over here.

1089
01:17:08,243 --> 01:17:09,453
Go on then.

1090
01:17:11,872 --> 01:17:14,462
Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.

1091
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:18,195
Wow. You're a talker too. You and Wade.

1092
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:21,490
I've been trying to tell you assholes,
you've got the wrong girl.

1093
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,075
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1094
01:17:23,175 --> 01:17:26,787
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1095
01:17:26,887 --> 01:17:28,163
Like a cockroach...

1096
01:17:28,263 --> 01:17:29,563
but uglier.

1097
01:17:30,599 --> 01:17:34,059
Now, I may not feel, but he does.

1098
01:17:35,145 --> 01:17:37,025
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1099
01:17:45,947 --> 01:17:47,447
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1100
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:49,914
Fuck, you're old.

1101
01:17:51,578 --> 01:17:53,980
Fake laugh. Hiding real pain.

1102
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,399
Go get Silver Balls.

1103
01:17:55,499 --> 01:17:57,693
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1104
01:17:57,793 --> 01:18:00,303
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money.

1105
01:18:00,754 --> 01:18:04,094
No, you know that bad guy that you let go?

1106
01:18:04,674 --> 01:18:06,535
He's got my girl.

1107
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:08,015
You're gonna help me get her back.

1108
01:18:08,428 --> 01:18:10,205
Wade? Is that you?

1109
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:14,725
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,
and I got an offer that you can't refuse.

1110
01:18:17,437 --> 01:18:18,547
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1111
01:18:18,647 --> 01:18:20,674
It's a big house. It's funny
that I only ever see two of you.

1112
01:18:20,774 --> 01:18:24,074
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1113
01:18:27,614 --> 01:18:29,015
And that is why, in my opinion...

1114
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:32,325
the movie Cocoon is pure pornography.

1115
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,563
Who brought this twinkly man?

1116
01:18:34,663 --> 01:18:36,690
Twinkly, but deadly.

1117
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:40,840
My chrome-penised friend back there
has agreed to do me this solid.

1118
01:18:41,419 --> 01:18:45,365
In exchange, I said that I would
consider joining his boy band.

1119
01:18:45,465 --> 01:18:46,700
It's not boy band.

1120
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,840
Sure it's not.

1121
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:50,847
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1122
01:18:51,638 --> 01:18:54,041
I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool...

1123
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:57,771
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1124
01:18:58,436 --> 01:19:00,146
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

1125
01:19:06,027 --> 01:19:07,027
Dopinder?

1126
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:09,989
What was that?

1127
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:17,663
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1128
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:19,566
Ban who?

1129
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,402
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1130
01:19:22,502 --> 01:19:24,112
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1131
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:28,012
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish,
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

1132
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:30,952
I did not tell him to do that.

1133
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:33,705
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1134
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:36,958
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1135
01:19:37,058 --> 01:19:38,126
I'm so proud of you.

1136
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:40,462
Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.

1137
01:19:40,562 --> 01:19:41,421
Kill him.

1138
01:19:41,521 --> 01:19:43,590
And then, win Gita back...

1139
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:46,426
the old fashioned way:
with your boyish charm.

1140
01:19:46,526 --> 01:19:47,856
Kidnap her.

1141
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:50,574
He's super dead.

1142
01:19:56,036 --> 01:19:57,604
I presume a crisp high five?

1143
01:19:57,704 --> 01:19:59,044
For you? 10.

1144
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,276
Okay, guys, let's get out there
and make a difference.

1145
01:20:03,376 --> 01:20:05,246
You know what to do.

1146
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:08,843
Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1147
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,050
Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

1148
01:20:13,553 --> 01:20:15,122
Not often a dude ruins your face...

1149
01:20:15,222 --> 01:20:18,125
skull-stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama...

1150
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:22,337
and personally sees to four
of your five shittiest moments.

1151
01:20:22,437 --> 01:20:26,607
Let's just say, it's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

1152
01:20:39,579 --> 01:20:40,856
Hey.

1153
01:20:40,956 --> 01:20:42,246
Where's your duffle bag?

1154
01:21:01,101 --> 01:21:02,521
Bandhu?

1155
01:21:04,062 --> 01:21:06,131
Leave a message and have a happy day.

1156
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:07,507
God damn it!

1157
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:12,779
I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way
with two swords and maximum effort.

1158
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,780
Cue the music.

1159
01:21:30,964 --> 01:21:33,424
Wade Wilson!

1160
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:35,587
What's my name?

1161
01:21:36,219 --> 01:21:37,799
I'mma fuckin' spell it out for ya.

1162
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,166
Go get some.

1163
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:42,376
Superhero landing.

1164
01:21:42,476 --> 01:21:44,476
She's gonna do a superhero landing.
Wait for it.

1165
01:21:49,107 --> 01:21:50,267
Superhero landing!

1166
01:21:50,817 --> 01:21:51,897
You know, that's really hard
on your knees.

1167
01:21:52,235 --> 01:21:53,645
Totally impractical. They all do it.

1168
01:21:54,154 --> 01:21:57,391
You're a lovely lady,
but I'm saving myself for Francis.

1169
01:21:57,491 --> 01:21:58,642
That's why I brought him.

1170
01:21:58,742 --> 01:22:01,952
I prefer not to hit a woman, so please...

1171
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:12,259
I mean, that's why I brought her?

1172
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:15,909
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... That's...

1173
01:22:16,009 --> 01:22:17,536
Just give us a second. Yeah.

1174
01:22:17,636 --> 01:22:18,966
There you go. Hashtag it.

1175
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:22,177
Go get her, tiger.

1176
01:22:28,855 --> 01:22:32,605
I so pity the dude who pressures
her into prom sex.

1177
01:22:33,318 --> 01:22:34,858
All right, then. Fire!

1178
01:22:46,623 --> 01:22:48,191
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1179
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,276
Language, please.

1180
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:50,536
Suck a cock.

1181
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,240
Look away, child.

1182
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:20,319
Look away!

1183
01:23:27,664 --> 01:23:28,940
Wait!

1184
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,150
Wait!

1185
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,193
Cease fire!

1186
01:23:31,293 --> 01:23:32,569
Cease fire!

1187
01:23:32,669 --> 01:23:34,129
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1188
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:39,159
You only work
for that shit-spackled muppet fart.

1189
01:23:39,259 --> 01:23:43,246
So, I'mma give you a chance
for y'all to lay down your firearms...

1190
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:46,291
in exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

1191
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:49,851
possibly even lover-like treatment.

1192
01:23:51,897 --> 01:23:53,131
Fine.

1193
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:54,151
Commando!

1194
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:07,256
Teabag!

1195
01:25:11,852 --> 01:25:12,812
Bob?

1196
01:25:13,895 --> 01:25:14,796
Wade?

1197
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:16,131
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since...

1198
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:18,521
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
- Since TGI Fridays.

1199
01:25:19,317 --> 01:25:21,027
Well, what the hell!

1200
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:23,111
God, come here, you.

1201
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:27,242
How are the kids? Good?

1202
01:25:27,784 --> 01:25:29,644
And Gail?
She's still fixing that tuna casserole?

1203
01:25:29,744 --> 01:25:32,544
So good! But bad for the waistline,
if you know what I'm talking about.

1204
01:25:39,254 --> 01:25:42,532
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1205
01:25:42,632 --> 01:25:43,682
That is so sweet.

1206
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:46,055
Thanks.

1207
01:25:58,315 --> 01:26:01,905
Does he write you notes too?
He's such a romantic.

1208
01:26:02,277 --> 01:26:03,647
Don't worry, baby. I'm comin'.

1209
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,070
Fire!

1210
01:26:13,663 --> 01:26:15,123
Hey!

1211
01:26:15,457 --> 01:26:16,417
Climb on!

1212
01:26:53,453 --> 01:26:55,003
Motherfucking...

1213
01:27:06,383 --> 01:27:08,843
Motherfucker should have worn
his brown pants.

1214
01:27:11,638 --> 01:27:12,808
You were right, beautiful.

1215
01:27:13,682 --> 01:27:15,392
Red really is my color.

1216
01:27:16,309 --> 01:27:17,210
Wade?

1217
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,190
Don't worry, baby...

1218
01:27:18,645 --> 01:27:20,645
I'mma get you out of that shit-box.

1219
01:27:21,148 --> 01:27:23,300
What better way to crawl back inside
that head of yours?

1220
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,260
Oh, you never left.

1221
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,429
But you did, asshole!

1222
01:27:27,529 --> 01:27:28,989
Deep breath, darling.

1223
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:31,662
Oh, wait.

1224
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:34,334
Wrong choice of words.

1225
01:27:36,538 --> 01:27:39,358
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1226
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,538
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1227
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,000
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.

1228
01:27:44,504 --> 01:27:47,407
When I'm finished...
parts will have to grow back you.

1229
01:27:47,507 --> 01:27:48,627
Good one.

1230
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:51,411
Yep, that was a good one.

1231
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:52,471
Let's dance.

1232
01:27:53,847 --> 01:27:56,220
And by dance, I mean...
let's try to kill each other.

1233
01:28:50,904 --> 01:28:53,114
Fine. Fists.

1234
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:55,236
Sounds like your last Saturday night.

1235
01:30:17,157 --> 01:30:19,237
Asshole!

1236
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:16,590
Hang in there, baby!

1237
01:31:17,092 --> 01:31:19,052
- Wade!
- I gotcha!

1238
01:31:22,472 --> 01:31:24,432
I got a plan. You're not gonna like it.

1239
01:31:35,068 --> 01:31:36,188
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1240
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,659
Don't worry. I'm totally on top of this.

1241
01:32:00,677 --> 01:32:01,757
Damn it!

1242
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:05,559
Maximum effort!

1243
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:48,891
Thanks.

1244
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:55,484
Just take it slow.

1245
01:33:05,909 --> 01:33:08,539
Oh, my God! That was so...

1246
01:33:39,568 --> 01:33:41,148
There are no words!

1247
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:45,815
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

1248
01:33:46,575 --> 01:33:47,585
What?

1249
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,830
You stupid fucking idiot.

1250
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:57,923
Did you really think
there was a cure... for that?

1251
01:33:59,838 --> 01:34:00,758
What?

1252
01:34:01,214 --> 01:34:02,304
You heard me.

1253
01:34:04,092 --> 01:34:05,202
No.

1254
01:34:05,302 --> 01:34:06,552
No!

1255
01:34:13,727 --> 01:34:16,727
So, you mean to say...

1256
01:34:17,522 --> 01:34:21,782
after all this, you can't fix me?

1257
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,429
It sounds even stupider when you say it.

1258
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:29,619
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1259
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:35,295
Any last words?

1260
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:38,247
What's my name?

1261
01:34:39,377 --> 01:34:40,612
Who fucking cares?

1262
01:34:40,712 --> 01:34:41,502
Wade!

1263
01:34:43,131 --> 01:34:45,511
Four or five moments.

1264
01:34:46,092 --> 01:34:47,035
I'm sorry?

1265
01:34:47,135 --> 01:34:49,505
Four or five moments, that's all it takes.

1266
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:51,102
To?

1267
01:34:52,265 --> 01:34:53,595
Be a hero.

1268
01:34:55,602 --> 01:34:58,296
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.

1269
01:34:58,396 --> 01:35:01,976
Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero,
go to work a hero.

1270
01:35:02,776 --> 01:35:04,511
Not true.

1271
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:09,781
Over a lifetime, there are only four
or five moments that really matter.

1272
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:12,602
Moments when you're offered a choice.

1273
01:35:12,702 --> 01:35:16,872
To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw,
save a friend...

1274
01:35:17,666 --> 01:35:20,286
spare an enemy.

1275
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:22,090
In these moments...

1276
01:35:22,879 --> 01:35:25,759
everything else falls away.

1277
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:29,006
The way the world sees us.

1278
01:35:29,386 --> 01:35:30,386
The way we...

1279
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:35,641
Why?

1280
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:38,879
You were droning on.

1281
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:41,965
Sure, I may be stuck
looking like pepperoni flatbread...

1282
01:35:42,065 --> 01:35:44,855
but at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1283
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:47,740
If wearing superhero tights...

1284
01:35:48,196 --> 01:35:49,598
means sparing psychopaths...

1285
01:35:49,698 --> 01:35:51,808
then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em.

1286
01:35:51,908 --> 01:35:54,311
Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

1287
01:35:54,411 --> 01:35:55,520
Just promise...

1288
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:59,316
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout
for the next four moments.

1289
01:35:59,416 --> 01:36:00,984
Oh, shit.

1290
01:36:01,084 --> 01:36:06,990
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy,
about to stand in front of a girl...

1291
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,367
and tell her...

1292
01:36:08,467 --> 01:36:10,494
What the fuck am I gonna tell her?

1293
01:36:10,594 --> 01:36:13,854
Well, you better figure it out.

1294
01:36:15,307 --> 01:36:16,541
I can't even tell you...

1295
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:17,731
I deserved that. That, too.

1296
01:36:18,477 --> 01:36:20,170
No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

1297
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:22,060
Start talking!

1298
01:36:24,107 --> 01:36:25,687
I'm sorry.

1299
01:36:25,942 --> 01:36:27,402
I'm so sorry.

1300
01:36:28,236 --> 01:36:30,776
For everything, I'm sorry for leaving...

1301
01:36:32,282 --> 01:36:34,309
I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner.

1302
01:36:34,409 --> 01:36:36,436
It's been rough couple of years.

1303
01:36:36,536 --> 01:36:37,196
Rough?

1304
01:36:45,003 --> 01:36:46,843
I live in a crackhouse.

1305
01:36:48,089 --> 01:36:49,419
With a family of 12.

1306
01:36:51,176 --> 01:36:52,661
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1307
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:55,747
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1308
01:36:55,847 --> 01:37:01,687
There's nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1309
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,990
So, you live in a house.

1310
01:37:20,831 --> 01:37:23,791
I should have come and found you sooner.

1311
01:37:25,252 --> 01:37:29,212
But, baby, the guy under this mask,
he ain't the same one that you remember.

1312
01:37:33,593 --> 01:37:34,803
You mean this mask?

1313
01:37:54,948 --> 01:37:56,528
And this one.

1314
01:37:57,993 --> 01:37:59,793
In case the other fell off.

1315
01:38:02,747 --> 01:38:04,983
All right. Yeah, just...

1316
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,735
Like a Band-Aid, just give it a...

1317
01:38:06,835 --> 01:38:08,987
Owdie 5,000.

1318
01:38:09,087 --> 01:38:10,047
Wait, wait, wait...

1319
01:38:12,007 --> 01:38:13,257
Are you sure?

1320
01:38:15,135 --> 01:38:16,145
I'm sure.

1321
01:38:26,646 --> 01:38:27,516
Wow.

1322
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:30,019
Yeah.

1323
01:38:36,948 --> 01:38:38,278
Hey...

1324
01:38:40,535 --> 01:38:44,749
After a brief adjustment period
and a bunch of drinks...

1325
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:48,126
it's a face...

1326
01:38:52,589 --> 01:38:54,219
I'd be happy to sit on.

1327
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:05,335
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1328
01:39:05,435 --> 01:39:06,225
No.

1329
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,672
Super-penis.

1330
01:39:08,772 --> 01:39:10,652
Come on, Wade. Language.

1331
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:12,279
Young one is present.

1332
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,178
What are you still doing?

1333
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:17,931
Get out of here. Go make yourself useful!

1334
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:20,767
You, go be a really big brother
to someone.

1335
01:39:20,867 --> 01:39:22,561
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

1336
01:39:22,661 --> 01:39:24,563
And you, chicken noodle...

1337
01:39:24,663 --> 01:39:26,398
nothing compares to you.

1338
01:39:26,498 --> 01:39:28,525
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1339
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,335
That's all right. You're cool.

1340
01:39:33,255 --> 01:39:34,906
What in the ass?

1341
01:39:35,006 --> 01:39:38,046
That was not mean! I'm proud of you!

1342
01:39:38,468 --> 01:39:41,580
We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.

1343
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,750
For a second there, it felt like
we were three mini-lion robots...

1344
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:47,060
coming together to form one super robot.

1345
01:39:47,936 --> 01:39:49,087
There's a stupid.

1346
01:39:49,187 --> 01:39:50,227
Yeah.

1347
01:39:53,692 --> 01:39:58,072
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1348
01:40:01,825 --> 01:40:02,955
Come here.

1349
01:40:12,836 --> 01:40:15,796
Wham! As promised.

1350
01:40:28,852 --> 01:40:29,961
See?

1351
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:33,590
You don't need to be a superhero
to get the girl.

1352
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:36,570
The right girl will bring out
the hero in you.

1353
01:40:37,068 --> 01:40:40,514
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot.
Pull out.

1354
01:40:40,614 --> 01:40:42,140
There we go, that looks nice.

1355
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,559
That's gonna be about the only thing
that's pulling out tonight.

1356
01:40:44,659 --> 01:40:47,979
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?

1357
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:51,858
Till next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood pool guy singing...

1358
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:57,838
I'm never gonna dance again
the way I danced with you

1359
01:47:07,793 --> 01:47:09,343
You're still here?

1360
01:47:11,963 --> 01:47:15,013
It's over. Go home.

1361
01:47:16,676 --> 01:47:21,006
You're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

1362
01:47:22,057 --> 01:47:25,043
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1363
01:47:25,143 --> 01:47:27,754
With an eye patch
and a saucy little leather number?

1364
01:47:27,854 --> 01:47:29,484
Go. Go.

1365
01:47:35,737 --> 01:47:38,223
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1366
01:47:38,323 --> 01:47:41,476
For the sequel, we're gonna have Cable.

1367
01:47:41,576 --> 01:47:43,937
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1368
01:47:44,037 --> 01:47:46,273
We have no idea who we're gonna
cast yet, but it could be anybody.

1369
01:47:46,373 --> 01:47:49,609
Just need a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren...

1370
01:47:49,709 --> 01:47:52,154
Keira Knightley. She's got range.
Who knows.

1371
01:47:52,254 --> 01:47:53,613
Anyway, big secret.

1372
01:47:53,713 --> 01:47:58,223
And don't leave your garbage all lying
around. It's a total dick move.

1373
01:47:59,177 --> 01:48:00,262
Go.
