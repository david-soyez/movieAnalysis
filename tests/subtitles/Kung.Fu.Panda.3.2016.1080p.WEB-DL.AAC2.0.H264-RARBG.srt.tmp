1
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,183
Stairs.

2
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,602
I do not think I can...

3
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,231
You guys, just start without me.

4
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,732
I will catch up!

5
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,371
Sweet.

6
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,891
Inner peace.

7
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,509
Inner peace.

8
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,769
Itchy nose.

9
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,240
Finally, inner peace.

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Now what?

11
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,539
Kai, old friend.

12
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:55,672
Master Oogway.

13
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,836
Our battle ended 500 years ago!

14
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:01,721
Well, now I am ready for a rematch.

15
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,813
Took you long enough!

16
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,696
you have grown stronger.

17
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,919
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,840
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

19
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:37,425
No!

20
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,416
Yes.

21
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,387
And soon I will have your power, too.

22
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:45,848
When will you realize?
The more you take, the less you have.

23
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:11,788
With your chi, I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

24
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,843
And this time,
you will not be there to stop me.

25
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,798
It was never my destiny to stop you.

26
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,931
I have set another on that path.

27
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,347
Then I will find him...

28
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:32,984
and take his chi, too.

29
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,384
Justice is about to be served!

30
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,524
we will have two Justice Platters, please.

31
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,348
- Three.
- Three.

32
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,312
And a few tofu buns.

33
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,812
The spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that?

34
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:56,814
She wants it on the side.

35
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,435
- On the side.
- On the side.

36
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:01,364
Go, Dragon Warrior! You can do it!

37
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,491
Go, Dragon Warrior!

38
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:03,737
Defend the Valley!

39
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,069
Dragon Warrior!

40
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,526
Go, Dragon Warrior!

41
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,406
Defend the Valley!

42
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,211
You guys are not doing the Dramatic Pose,
are you?

43
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,751
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

44
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:24,216
You guys, never underestimate
the power of a Dramatic Entrance.

45
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,587
I have heard about some masters who can win
a fight just by throwing open a door.

46
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,597
Dramatic Entrance?

47
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,892
Master Shifu.

48
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,893
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

49
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,565
Really? I was just making...

50
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,773
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

51
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:41,904
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

52
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,442
Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.

53
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,920
Nice Dramatic Entrance.
what is the occasion?

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,800
Today will be my final class.

55
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:04,458
Your final...? Wait.

56
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:07,256
I did not even know you were sick!
Although you have been looking a little...

57
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,261
I am not sick.

58
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,352
...healthy. A little healthy.
A lot, actually.

59
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:14,096
My final class, because from now on...

60
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,141
your training will be in the hands
of the Dragon Warrior.

61
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
What?

62
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,244
Me, teach? Why not Tigress?
She is always telling everyone what to do.

63
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
Be quiet, Po.

64
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,612
You see what I mean?

65
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,276
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.

66
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,775
You are.

67
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,246
Come on, they are the Five.
What could I teach them?

68
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,868
There is always something more to learn,
even for a master.

69
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,252
For instance...

70
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,383
let me show you another move...

71
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,839
the Dramatic Exit.

72
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,172
what is that?

73
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,546
Wow! Are you kidding me?

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
where did he go?

75
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,021
Master.

76
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,851
he is gone, guys. it is cool.

77
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:02,315
We await your instruction, Master.

78
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,066
All you have to lose is our respect.

79
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:11,323
I mean, seriously, how bad can it be?

80
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,285
Very bad!

81
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:13,324
Very, very bad!

82
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,327
Okay, okay. let us switch it up.

83
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,329
Monkey! Immovable Mountain Stance!

84
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,541
Yes, Master!

85
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:22,128
Tigress, Tornado Back Flip!

86
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,207
Yes, Master.

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,380
Oh, no! Fire!

88
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,421
- Fire!
- Stop!

89
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,046
Sorry! My fault.

90
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,716
Crane, go high.
I mean low! Low!

91
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,099
Ah, my claw thingy!

92
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,931
Viper and Tigress, do, like,
a Totem Pole Poison Technique!

93
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,346
You two, do a Swarming Insect Bite...

94
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,726
with a Yellow Tail, Yellow Jacket,
Spicy Tuna...

95
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,194
I am sorry.

96
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,736
Good job, Po.

97
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,866
Did you at least learn a little something?

98
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,043
Yes.

99
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,871
That you cannot teach.

100
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,206
And Tigress is flammable, it turns out.

101
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:14,931
Yeah, that was a complete disaster.

102
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,010
I am glad we are not Po right now.

103
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,215
What a loser!

104
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,565
What was Shifu thinking?

105
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,979
What was Oogway thinking?

106
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,905
I think he heard us.

107
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,610
I did not hear anything.

108
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:30,654
He said you are a loser.

109
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:45,045
I am sorry, Oogway.

110
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,709
Would you stop doing that?

111
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:50,424
How was your first day teaching?

112
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,924
Humiliating.

113
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:52,915
I heard.

114
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,546
Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?

115
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:56,763
I heard from Monkey, and Crane,
and Mantis...

116
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,973
and your dad,
and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop...

117
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,645
and those ducks you just passed...

118
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,387
and Tigress told me.

119
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:06,435
Did she also tell you that it will never
happen again? Because I am done.

120
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,650
Teaching or being humiliated?

121
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,480
Both! I do not know why you ever
thought I could teach that class.

122
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,398
Oh, I knew you could not.

123
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:16,485
What? You set me up to fail? Why?

124
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:21,331
If you only do what you can do,
you will never be more than you are now.

125
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,408
I do not want to be more! I like who I am.

126
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:27,246
You do not even know who you are.

127
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,502
What do you...? Of course I do.
I am the Dragon Warrior.

128
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:33,335
And what exactly does that mean,
Dragon Warrior?

129
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:41,643
It means, you know, just going around
and punching and kicking.

130
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,432
Defending the Valley! And stuff.

131
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:45,976
Punching and kicking?

132
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,309
You think that is what the great
Master Oogway saw for you?

133
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:56,027
A 500-year prophecy fulfilled
so you could spend your days kicking  ...

134
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,911
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

135
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:00,874
- Yes?
- No!

136
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:06,825
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po.
Against my better judgment.

137
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,793
More than you can see in yourself.

138
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:12,555
Incredible power awaits you.

139
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

140
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,565
Wow! What was that?

141
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,031
That was chi.

142
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,240
Wow!

143
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,859
what is chi?

144
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:44,696
The energy that flows
through all living things.

145
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:48,255
So you are saying if I teach,
I will be able to do cool stuff like that?

146
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,670
No. I am saying if you teach,
I will be able to do cool stuff like that.

147
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,551
Oh.

148
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:57,217
Mastering chi requires mastery of self.

149
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:02,927
Oogway sat alone in a cave for 30 years
asking one question.

150
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,888
"Who am I?"

151
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:06,887
"Who am I?"

152
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:10,274
I am lucky if I get five minutes
before you interrupt...

153
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,772
So now I have to sit alone in a cave
for 30 years?

154
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:13,864
Eventually.

155
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,569
After you master teaching.

156
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,899
Teaching? there is no way
I am ever going to be like you.

157
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,066
I am not trying to turn you into me.

158
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,294
I am trying to turn you into you.

159
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,619
Turn me into me?
Wait a second, that makes no...

160
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,917
Almost there, Shifu.

161
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,090
Just a little more confusing
and you will be the next Oogway.

162
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,430
Sorry, no offense, Master Oogway. I just...

163
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,854
I will let you get back
to your eternal peace.

164
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,972
What is this place?

165
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,854
My brother's farm?

166
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:33,846
If I stepped on you, would you die?

167
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,147
Yes.

168
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,693
The mortal realm.

169
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,910
You hear that, Oogway? I am back.

170
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:47,366
Kai has returned!

171
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,910
Who?

172
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,827
Kai. General Kai.

173
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,075
Supreme Warlord of all China.

174
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:00,375
The Jade Slayour. Master of Pain.

175
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,341
You may know me as
the Beast of Vengeance.

176
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,221
Maker of Widows?

177
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,061
Okay, I used to work with Oogway.

178
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,558
Oh, Master Oogway!

179
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,680
Now, he was a great warrior.

180
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,056
we have heard of Master Oogway.

181
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,232
Okay, okay, enough. Silence!

182
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,237
Find Oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

183
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:37,044
By the time I am done with them,
Oogway...

184
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:41,714
there will be no one left
who will even remember your name.

185
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,757
Kai is coming!

186
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,925
I am ready...

187
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,604
to teach you a lesson.

188
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,101
Teach me?
Oh, no! it is the Dragon Teacher!

189
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,733
Yeah, he is so handsome!

190
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,930
Thank you for the compliment.

191
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,938
No! Please do not teach me to death!

192
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,282
Po?

193
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,280
Oh, hey, Dad. what is up?

194
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,990
I was just... stopping by for a little soak.

195
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,246
Okay. what is wrong?

196
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,121
Nothing.

197
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,706
Nothing? I come home to find you
taking a bath with your dolls...

198
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:22,713
Action figures.

199
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:26,764
...and instead of adding bath salts to the water,
you just added Szechuan peppercorns.

200
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Szechuan...

201
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:30,854
Oh, my tenders!

202
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,142
Okay, yes, something's wrong.

203
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:38,393
There, there, son.
You tell your daddy all about it.

204
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:39,647
Lift your arm.

205
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:42,938
Shifu says I do not know what it means
to be the Dragon Warrior.

206
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,283
Now I have to be a teacher?

207
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,899
I thought I finally knew who I was.

208
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,275
If I am not the Dragon Warrior, who am I?

209
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,743
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?

210
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,953
Po, that is a promotion!

211
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,294
Take the job, son!

212
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,909
And, someday when you are in charge
of the whole Jade Palace...

213
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:00,826
I can sell noodles in the lobby!

214
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,501
Why are you still here taking a bath
like a baby?

215
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,745
Get out! Get up!

216
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,836
Go, go, go!
Franchise expansion awaits us!

217
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,013
But what about
the Dragon Warrior look-alike contest?

218
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,802
Mrs. Chow always wins that.

219
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:13,854
Skadoosh.

220
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,479
And the Dragon Warrior dumpling-eating contest?
I have to defend my title.

221
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,187
No one's going to beat your
dumpling-eating record.

222
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,268
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

223
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,320
Go! Go!

224
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,819
who is eating my dumplings?

225
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,190
And who is paying for them?

226
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,200
101! 102!

227
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,125
103!

228
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,338
Yeah!

229
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,722
Is that a new record?

230
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,797
Who are you?

231
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,933
I am Li Shan.

232
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:54,971
What?

233
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,807
I am Li Shan.

234
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,811
I am looking for my son.

235
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,319
You lost your son?

236
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,689
Yes.

237
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,815
Many years ago.

238
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,995
I lost my father.

239
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,202
I am very sorry.

240
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,492
Thank you.

241
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,751
Well, good luck to you.

242
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:23,959
You, too.

243
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,751
I hope you find your son.

244
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,593
And I hope you find your father.

245
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,890
Son?

246
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,767
Oh, my gosh, it is you!

247
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,355
Well, do not just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

248
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,573
I cannot believe you are alive!

249
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,080
I thought I lost you forever,
Little Lotus.

250
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,829
Okay. This is very embarrassing...

251
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:05,213
but I think you have got me confused
with a panthe named Lotus.

252
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,420
My name is Po.

253
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,750
Oh, right, you would not know.

254
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,915
Okay. See, Little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.

255
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,506
- Really?
- Really!

256
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:17,601
I cannot believe it!
After all these years, you are really here?

257
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,218
This is amazing!

258
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,354
Oh, Dad!

259
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,390
Come! Say hi to...

260
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,944
I do not know what
I am supposed to call you.

261
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,938
I am pretty sure he said his name is Li.

262
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,860
You.

263
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,729
Come here.

264
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,785
Thank you, thank you
for taking such good care of my son.

265
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:39,122
Your son? Now, hold on just a minute.

266
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:43,079
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

267
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,581
Look at that.

268
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,963
- Our bellies could be brothers!
- That is so cool.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,960
Hey, son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

270
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,712
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

271
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:54,845
- Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
- it is like looking in a   mirror.

272
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:59,349
I cannot believe
we are taking a picture together.

273
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,477
But I still do not understand.

274
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,519
I thought Po was the only panthe left.

275
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,608
No. there is a whole bunch of us.

276
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,069
Where?

277
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,489
A secret panthe village
in the mountains.

278
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,698
A secret panthe...

279
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,493
But how did you know where I was?

280
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,493
I received a message that led me here.

281
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:26,916
How could you receive a message
if no one could find you?

282
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,207
Sounds suspicious to me.

283
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,876
No, it was a message from the universe.

284
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,298
Rats!

285
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:37,679
Now, what is all this
about a Dragon Warrior?

286
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:41,218
How did you know I was a Dragon Warrior?
Did the universe tell you that, too?

287
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,676
No, the poster did.

288
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,814
And the gift shop.

289
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,675
I bought a tiny cup.

290
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,647
Oh, right, of course!

291
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,521
You have no idea.
there is so much to show you.

292
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,936
you are going to be so awesomely proud.

293
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:55,744
Come on, come on!

294
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:00,239
I am already awesomely proud.

295
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,834
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

296
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:07,081
Feeling the burn.

297
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,038
Do you have panthe asthmom, too?

298
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,713
Does that run in the family?

299
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,552
Dad, you are going to love this.

300
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,338
it is, like, the coolest thing ever.

301
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:20,012
This is the Hall of Heroes.

302
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,972
Home of the most priceless
kung fu artifacts in all of China!

303
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:26,063
Whoa! This place is...

304
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,389
Awesome? Were you going to say...

305
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,394
You were going to say "awesome," right?
Because it totally is!

306
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,396
Totally!

307
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,397
But be super careful.
Everything's very fragile here.

308
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:36,229
Like the Urn of Whispering Warriors.
Someone broke that once.

309
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,896
- Who?
- Some idiot.

310
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:38,945
Wow!

311
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,656
This is Master Flying Rhinofs
battle armor!

312
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:44,198
I wonder if I could fit in that.

313
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:46,582
Get out of my head, Dad!
I have wondered the same thing!

314
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,750
If I could fit in it?

315
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,498
If you could? No, if I could fit.

316
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:50,959
Dad, check it out!

317
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,095
Master Ramys crossbow,
the infamous Gate Smasher.

318
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,247
Dad, look at this!

319
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,295
The battle helmets of Master Ratos army.
they are so tiny!

320
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,759
Master Dolphings waterproof armor!
This is my favorite.

321
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,932
Check it out. it is the legendary
battle rickshaw of Emperor Hawk.

322
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,806
Sweet ride.

323
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,732
Dad, what are you doing?
we are not supposed to touch anything!

324
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,520
Sorry, sorry. Should I put it back?

325
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,444
Yeah, you probably should.

326
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,443
You look so cool, though.

327
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,106
How does it feel?

328
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,453
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

329
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,279
Does it feel like you are impenetrable?

330
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,624
Does it feel like
you could take on a thousand warriors...

331
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,250
and emerge unscathed?

332
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,293
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

333
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,667
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

334
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,683
I think I just peed a little.

335
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:53,273
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

336
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,686
Charge!

337
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,324
Faster, faster, faster!

338
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,784
Thumb war!

339
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:07,284
Reinforcements!

340
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:08,866
No fair. No fair.

341
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,329
Yeah!

342
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,829
This is so much fu-...

343
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,963
Here we go! Go, go, go!

344
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,633
- Awesome!
- Faster, faster, faster.

345
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:21,424
There, there.

346
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,475
I am fine, I am fine.

347
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,586
There you go.

348
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:27,355
- Dolphin-Style Attack!
- You got me.

349
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,057
Dolphin-Style Retreat!

350
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,057
Go long, son!

351
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,694
I was not ready!

352
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,266
- Coming back at you.
- I got it.

353
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,865
- I am going high!
- There you go. Come on, throw it!

354
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,525
I am coming for you.

355
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:45,611
Bring it on, Master Rhino.

356
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,656
Here I come!

357
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:58,792
I am going to get you. I am going to get you!

358
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:02,705
I am going to get you, I am going to get you!
I am going to get you.

359
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,046
who is got you? who is going to get you?

360
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,892
who is going to get you?
Yeah. who is going to get you?

361
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,393
Master Rhino.

362
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,099
What? what is wrong?

363
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:21,398
Hello.

364
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,072
Guys, guys.

365
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,450
you are never going to guess who just
showed up. Not in a million years.

366
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,359
You just try.

367
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:29,737
Your father!

368
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,583
How did you just guess that?

369
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,868
Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah, of course.
We look exactly the same.

370
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:35,752
Dad, say hi to my friends.

371
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,209
Mantis, Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

372
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,381
Viper, was it?

373
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,379
Monkey, sir.

374
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,840
they are kind of my best friends.
And this...

375
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,050
This is Master Shifu. Legend.

376
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:49,548
It is an honor to meet you,
Master Panthe.

377
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:52,684
Perhaps your father would care to join us
in the training hall.

378
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,643
Your son will be teaching the class.

379
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,560
I am sure he is tired.

380
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,443
I am sure you are tired.
he is tired.

381
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,859
I am going to show him
to the Chrysanthemum Suite.

382
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:04,437
What, tired? No, I am fine.
I would love to watch you teach.

383
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,364
Trust me, it will be more fun
just to watch me...

384
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:07,703
Fight!

385
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:08,858
What is that?

386
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,315
The Valley's under attack.

387
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,278
Son? Under attack?

388
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:14,447
This is perfect!

389
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,124
Now you can see what being
the Dragon Warrior's all about!

390
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,164
Follow me!

391
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:29,014
Enemies of justice, prepare for war!

392
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,641
Are you kidding me? Whoa!

393
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,903
what is the deal with the green guys?

394
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:44,024
Some kind of jade zombies.

395
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,646
Jade zombies?

396
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,282
Jombies! Jinx!

397
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,988
Lotus, be careful!

398
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,410
it is okay, Dad, I do this every day!

399
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,451
Whoa! I recognize these guys.

400
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:59,715
The Master Badger Twins,
with their Crushing Double-Gong technique!

401
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,789
Yeah, that is the one!

402
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,964
And that guy is...

403
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:06,002
No! Master Porcupine!

404
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,466
I thought he died a hundred years ago.

405
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,260
These guys are legend!

406
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,679
Get a quick sketch of us.

407
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,233
Did you get it? Did you get it?

408
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:25,982
I blinked.

409
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:27,613
Can we get another one?

410
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,779
I am being choked by Master Porcupine.
This is so cool.

411
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,453
Oh, look. it is you!

412
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,413
Po, focus!

413
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:42,623
"Message from the universe."
I will give you a message from the universe.

414
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,326
Stay away from my son!

415
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:46,594
Sorry, Dad. I will clean up later.

416
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:49,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not my good pan! Take this one.

417
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,050
Lotus! Watch out!

418
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,135
Dad, check out my Dumplings of Doom.

419
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:12,695
got you.

420
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,118
I see you.

421
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,578
Your chi will soon be mine.

422
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,833
- Is he talking to me?
- Which one? they are all talking.

423
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,175
Whoa, you are right. that is so scary.

424
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,380
We should try that, too.
Maybe it would be scary back at them.

425
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,011
Okay, but we have got to plan
what we are going to say first.

426
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:32,758
Otherwise, it will not be scary.
it will just be  .

427
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,259
it is not them talking, you idiots!

428
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:36,802
it is me talking through them. Kai!

429
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:38,387
Who?

430
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,430
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

431
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:48,061
- Did you see that?
- What just happened?

432
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,606
The green smoke, just poof!
And then poof!

433
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,281
Shifu, what was that?

434
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,239
Kai... Kai... Kai...

435
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,236
Nope, never heard of him.

436
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,199
Kai... Kai...

437
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,833
Where is it?

438
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:03,079
there is so much wisdom in here,
I cannot find anything.

439
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:04,121
Yes!

440
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,165
Behold.

441
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,715
All the answers will be found within.

442
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,051
What? it is blank?

443
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:18,602
Are you kidding me? Not again.

444
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,138
Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

445
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,562
Oh, okay. Here we go.

446
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,980
It is written in Oogway's hand.

447
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,441
"Long ago, I had a brother..."

448
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:32,032
Oogway had a brother?

449
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:35,527
"In arms. In arms." Sorry.
He says, "Brother-in-arms."

450
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,410
Maybe you should just unroll it
all at once?

451
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:43,036
"I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army."

452
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:47,793
And fighting by my side was Kai...

453
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,919
my closest friend.

454
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,839
One day, we were ambushed.

455
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,973
I was badly wounded.

456
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:03,351
My friend carried me for days,
looking for help...

457
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,639
until we came to a secret village...

458
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:08,735
high in the mountains.

459
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,690
An ancient place of healing.

460
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,612
A village of pandas.

461
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,397
Pandas?

462
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:18,575
Yes, pandas.

463
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:23,204
Pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me.

464
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:29,123
They taught me how to give chi.

465
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:38,422
But Kai wanted the power all to himself.

466
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:43,806
He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.

467
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,889
I had to stop him.

468
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:57,356
Our battle shook the earth...

469
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,322
until, finally...

470
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:02,823
I banished Kai to the Spirit Realm.

471
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:05,616
Should he ever return
to the mortal realm...

472
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:10,041
he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.

473
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,752
"True master of chi"?

474
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,922
Like you!

475
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,790
Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.

476
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:17,546
I need at least 30 more years,
and a cave.

477
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:18,759
We need a chi master.

478
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,509
He will continue stealing the chi of
masters until he has consumed it all.

479
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,932
We have to think of a way to stop him!

480
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:27,021
he shall get more and more powerful
with every master he defeats.

481
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,557
There is no choice. We fight.

482
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,390
I can teach you, son.

483
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,903
You can do this?

484
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:36,729
Of course. I am a panthe.

485
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,784
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

486
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,664
Okay, so what do I have to do?

487
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,658
You have to come home with me.

488
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,830
What?

489
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,407
To the secret village?

490
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:48,582
Yes, son.

491
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,120
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panthe.

492
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:56,035
You have to learn to live like a panthe,
sleep like a panthe...

493
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:57,996
eat like a panthe.

494
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,470
Those 103 dumplings?

495
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,340
I was just warming up.

496
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:06,605
I have always felt like
I was not eating up to my full potential.

497
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,894
No, you cannot take Po away from me.
No, no.

498
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,313
I want a second opinion.

499
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:13,691
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

500
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,691
I think he should go.

501
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:17,361
Fine, a third opinion.

502
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,649
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

503
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:22,493
Dad, you heard
what Shifu said Oogway said.

504
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,319
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

505
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:28,575
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

506
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:31,367
Well, I am a panthe.

507
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,455
I will pack you a lunch for the road.

508
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,007
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

509
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:50,774
does not matter what I think.
It only matters what the universe thinks.

510
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:52,847
So, that is a "no"?

511
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,603
Master, what are we going to do?

512
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:56,735
You are going to find out where Kai is.

513
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,402
Follow the trail
of those jade creatures.

514
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,229
But do not engage...

515
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:03,855
for with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

516
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,034
Why me? Is it because I asked?

517
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:08,493
No. It is because you can fly. Go!

518
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,701
Should have kept your beak shut.

519
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:12,915
And take Mantis.

520
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,125
Oh, man. Is it because I...?

521
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:15,164
Yes.

522
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:43,442
Lunch break.

523
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:45,986
You do not need to ask me twice.

524
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,910
Dad?

525
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:48,818
Yes?

526
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:49,865
Dad?

527
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,910
Yes?

528
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,081
What are you doing here?

529
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,749
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

530
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,918
Did you have to step on every rock?

531
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,787
No, I mean, why are you here?

532
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:02,754
What was I supposed to do?
What if the pandas do not have food you like?

533
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:06,506
you are never going to be able to save
the world on an empty stomach.

534
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,140
I consider my presence mission critical.

535
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:10,637
Yes, about that...

536
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,679
We cannot share the location
of the village with others. So...

537
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:17,855
Well, you think I cannot keep a secret?

538
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:22,274
I raised Po for 20 years
before I finally told him he was adopted.

539
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:23,266
Seriously?

540
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,277
Yeah.

541
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:27,358
Okay. I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.

542
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,782
You can fly?

543
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,164
I am a bird, Po.

544
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:50,092
we are here.

545
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,928
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

546
00:31:57,768 --> 00:31:59,728
And my son hates stairs.

547
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,310
So, let us go home.

548
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,985
we are pandas. We do not do stairs.

549
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:06,034
I have waited my whole life
to hear those words.

550
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,113
Rats.

551
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:21,708
Whoa...

552
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,891
This is the secret panthe village?

553
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,182
No wonder you keep it a secret.

554
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:41,976
If I lived here,
I would not tell anyone either.

555
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,440
Now you can "Whoa."

556
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,065
Whoa!

557
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,736
- let us go!
- Over here! Come on!

558
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,131
Look over there!

559
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,270
- My turn! My turn!
- Come on, faster, faster!

560
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,232
Li?

561
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,153
Everyone! Li's back!

562
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,401
- they are both back!
- He found his son!

563
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:31,444
- He made it!
- they are back!

564
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:33,236
- Li?
- He found his son!

565
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,070
Everyone! Li's back!

566
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,235
Hang on, we are coming!

567
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:39,164
He made it!

568
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:41,082
- They made it!
- Why are we running?

569
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,081
- Here we come!
- he is back!

570
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,833
They made it!

571
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,005
Li Shan is back!

572
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,007
Hi!

573
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,145
Everyone!

574
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,681
Everyone, gather around! This is my son!

575
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:02,935
- Hello, hi.
- he is here!

576
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:04,516
- you are here!
- Triplets!

577
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:05,981
Hi, I am Ku Ku!

578
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:07,151
- I am Meng Meng.
- I am Shuai Shuai.

579
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,949
- Your fur is soft.
- He smells like cookies.

580
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:12,652
he is so handsome, just like his father.

581
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:13,824
Thank you.

582
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,032
Son, these are your cousins.

583
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,783
Dim and Sum.

584
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:18,834
I have cousins!

585
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:19,867
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

586
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:21,697
Buns on a string.

587
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:22,955
We call it a snacklace.

588
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:23,996
that is right.

589
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:26,332
we will make you another one.

590
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:28,794
it is you!

591
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:31,545
So... that is nice. Yeah, hi!

592
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:33,508
I do not know who you are.

593
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:36,128
Stripy Baby. So beautiful.

594
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,177
Okay, careful with that.
that is my action figure.

595
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,391
- Can I keep her? Can I?
- No...

596
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:44,306
problem. Of course.

597
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,641
Yeah. that is why I brought her.

598
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:46,806
Take good care of her.

599
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:49,193
Yes! Stripy Baby.

600
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:54,147
You look just like me, but a baby.

601
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:59,823
you are like me, but old.

602
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:02,236
you are like me, but fatter!

603
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,205
you are like me, but...

604
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,209
with a hat.

605
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,292
He does wear a hat!

606
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:11,915
You all look like me.

607
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,010
let us feast in my son's honor.

608
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:19,512
What the...?

609
00:35:19,553 --> 00:35:21,893
Pandas do not walk. We roll!

610
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,020
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

611
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,066
Po, what are you doing? Po!

612
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,873
you are right,
that is better than walking.

613
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:56,054
- Yeah, that is the good stuff.
- Have some dumplings.

614
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:58,549
What kind of panthe
does not know how to roll?

615
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,222
Well, I am kind of new at this whole
"being a panthe" thing.

616
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,511
What kind of panthe are you?
You have a funny neck.

617
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:05,556
I am not a panthe at all.

618
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,389
- what is that?
- My hat.

619
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,103
- what is that?
- My beak.

620
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:07,892
- what is that?
- My wing.

621
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,735
- what is that?
- My dumplings.

622
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,940
No more questions! Go away, kid.

623
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,730
Here, son. I packed your chopsticks.

624
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:14,904
- Thanks, Dad.
- Wow.

625
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,282
Oh, my.

626
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:17,318
What?

627
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,861
What are those for?

628
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,074
These? These are chopsticks.
they are for picking up dumplings.

629
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,954
You mean you only eat one at a time?

630
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:28,156
- Yummy
- Yeah, yummy.

631
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:32,915
I knew I was not eating
up to my potential!

632
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,929
I am Mei Mei.

633
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:53,607
Wow, she is amazing. She is so beautiful.

634
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:54,937
that is sweet, Po.

635
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:59,442
But please, try to save all other
compliments until after the performance.

636
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:02,321
Me? No, I did not say...

637
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:05,454
Shut it.

638
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,162
After the performance.

639
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,292
Has it started yet?

640
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:15,004
Best ribbon dancer in the world!

641
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,296
At least, that is what she said.

642
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:19,007
Look away. Look away.

643
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,417
No. You cannot, can you?

644
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:24,086
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like...

645
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:25,086
that!

646
00:37:25,137 --> 00:37:26,137
Try to keep up.

647
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:29,971
I do not really know how to dance!

648
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:33,017
Of course you do. All pandas dance.

649
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,189
- I know what you were thinking.
- You do?

650
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,531
"How can one panthe be so beautiful?"

651
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:43,355
For me?

652
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,116
Po.

653
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,159
- Help me, Dads.
- Yeah, no, you are on your own.

654
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,542
you are doing great, son.

655
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:53,996
Your turn.

656
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,719
Yay, Po!

657
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:12,515
do not worry. you will get the hang of it.

658
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:15,937
I have so much to learn.

659
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,703
Wings of Surveillance!

660
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,490
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

661
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:30,203
Just because you say "Wings of"
before something...

662
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:32,043
it does not mean
that you are doing a special move.

663
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,829
it is like me saying "Antenna of Power"
or "Thorax of Making Sandwiches."

664
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:39,206
Wings of Disagreement.

665
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:40,592
Whoa! There.

666
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:45,722
Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc!
What are you doing out here?

667
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,719
Jade creatures attacked our villages.
we have tracked them here.

668
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:50,392
Stop!

669
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:54,981
They must be in there.

670
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:58,305
Master Shifu strongly advised us...

671
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,901
not to engage.

672
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:04,573
- we have have got to get in there.
- But Master Shifu said...

673
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:05,741
you are seriously afraid?

674
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:08,739
Even Master Chicken's going in there!
And he is a chicken.

675
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,254
- that is it. I am going in.
- Mantis! We have orders not to...

676
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:21,254
They need our help!

677
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,965
- Come on. I will go high, you go low.
- No, wait.

678
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,762
Fear the bug!

679
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,640
All right, you little...

680
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:30,759
Hold on, buddy. I am coming!

681
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:33,264
Antenna of Power! It did not work!

682
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,427
Mantis!

683
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,483
Mantis?

684
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:43,653
Mantis.

685
00:39:55,787 --> 00:39:57,617
Your chi is strong.

686
00:39:58,206 --> 00:39:59,616
Just like your friend...

687
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,786
the bug.

688
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:03,708
Mantis.

689
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,010
do not worry, little birdie.

690
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,020
I will put your chi to good use...

691
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:22,019
destroying the Jade Palace
and everyone in it.

692
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:23,314
No!

693
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,318
Wings of Regret!

694
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,374
Oh, yeah.

695
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,956
First day of panthe training!

696
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,041
All right, flower.

697
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,050
I am going to make you bloom.

698
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:50,182
Dad. Dad.

699
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,377
What? What? What is it?

700
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,506
- I am ready for my first day of panthe training.
- What?

701
00:40:53,553 --> 00:40:56,563
You know, learn to be a panthe,
master chi, save the world!

702
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,848
Pandas sleep till past noon.

703
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:01,732
So lesson number one is,
"Go back to bed."

704
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:04,231
Of course!

705
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,863
Nobody said this was going to be easy.

706
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,164
Did I oversleep?

707
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:17,331
You sure did.

708
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:18,499
Yes!

709
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:19,657
Yeah! Show him, kids!

710
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:21,545
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

711
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:22,871
How about this?
How about that?

712
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,036
Am I doing it? Is this good?

713
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:24,884
Whoa!

714
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,418
I got it! Ka-blam!

715
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,740
- Grandmom Panthe, heads up!
- Hello!

716
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,381
We better roll.

717
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:35,467
Po, lunch time.

718
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:42,935
Po?

719
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,020
You have got to let the hill tell you
where to roll.

720
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:47,234
Rookie mistake.

721
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:50,944
Dim, Sum, let us show him
how we go uphill!

722
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:54,026
it is beautiful.

723
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,782
Snack time. Po!

724
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:58,198
You can fly?

725
00:41:58,243 --> 00:41:59,243
I am coming in hot!

726
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:03,076
Get them while they are cold.

727
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:06,582
What are you doing there?

728
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,627
That food is for Po!

729
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,295
Throw it in!

730
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:14,758
There, there. that is it.

731
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:15,931
Feeling relaxed?

732
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:16,929
Totally.

733
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,310
Just let yourself fall into it.

734
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:20,348
Got it.

735
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
I am fine. I just...

736
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:29,441
There we go. Just let it all out.

737
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:30,613
that is my boy.

738
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:33,823
Get out of there!

739
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:37,658
My noodles!

740
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:38,989
Leave my noodles alone.

741
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:44,958
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.

742
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,458
Let me get some of that.

743
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,840
Hey, leave my hat alone!

744
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:55,837
We love noodles!

745
00:42:55,884 --> 00:42:57,144
More noodles!

746
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:58,637
Just like my Po.

747
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,844
What are you guys looking at?

748
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,692
that is how we roll! Cannonball!

749
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:17,905
Yeah!

750
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,711
Here, bring it up here.

751
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,751
Mom, look it!

752
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,093
How was that?

753
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:43,682
Whoa!

754
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:47,064
Now, you try again.
But do not try so hard.

755
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,232
Okay. Okay.

756
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:55,442
Much better.

757
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:04,538
Thanks, Dad.

758
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:06,327
For what?

759
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:10,131
You know, just for, you know,
showing me what it feels like...

760
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,417
to be a panthe.

761
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,711
- So, when do you think I will be ready?
- Ready?

762
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,377
You know, to learn how to master chi.

763
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,054
Soon. Real soon.

764
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:23,223
Come on, I want to show you something else.

765
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:24,263
Come on.

766
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:31,233
Sorry about the mess.
I do not usually get visitors.

767
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:44,622
Is this my mom?

768
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,460
I had this done on your 100th day.

769
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:58,133
Your mommom could not hold you still.

770
00:44:58,924 --> 00:45:01,134
You nearly ate the paper.

771
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:03,467
it is true.

772
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:04,802
What was she like?

773
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:09,847
She was the total package.

774
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:14,308
Smart, beautiful...

775
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:15,516
tremendous appetite.

776
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:19,526
She was the love of my life.

777
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:24,155
And then, just when I thought
I could not get any luckier...

778
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:25,955
along you came.

779
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:28,543
My Little Lotus.

780
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,669
I really had it all...

781
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:38,464
until that one moment...

782
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:46,137
when I lost everything.

783
00:46:23,216 --> 00:46:24,876
Dad.

784
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,926
You do not have to worry about
losing me ever again.

785
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,099
Okay?

786
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:40,862
Let me get some of that.

787
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:52,543
it is from the Eastern Province!

788
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:58,877
Master Lizard, Master Ox, Master Eagle.
All of them.

789
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:01,711
In every village from the sea to here...

790
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:04,595
every master in China...

791
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:05,723
has vanished.

792
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,259
Maybe they are all at a party.

793
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:08,262
Monkey.

794
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:09,683
I did not get invited either.

795
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:11,851
Kai has taken their chi.

796
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,520
We are all that stand between him...

797
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,309
and the knowledge
Oogway left in our care.

798
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:20,572
The villagers, evacuated?

799
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:21,607
Done, Master.

800
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:24,114
- Crane, Mantis?
- Still nothing.

801
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:25,612
Wait. it is them!

802
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:30,992
No!

803
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:46,424
Kai.

804
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:52,596
Nice.

805
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,310
Very tacky.

806
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:58,101
How dare you set foot on these grounds!

807
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,655
Look at you pathetic fools.

808
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:04,939
Groveling at the feet
of Oogway the Magnificent.

809
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:07,285
You are not fit to speak his name.

810
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:09,861
I am not fit, little kitten?

811
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,870
I fought by his side.

812
00:48:14,453 --> 00:48:17,003
I loved him like a brother.

813
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,709
And he betrayed me.

814
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:27,722
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

815
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:30,301
Go!

816
00:48:51,698 --> 00:48:53,198
how is that for a little kitten?

817
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:12,805
I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory.

818
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:15,224
Why not? He destroyed mine.

819
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:16,557
Mantis.

820
00:49:16,598 --> 00:49:18,678
It is me, your bestie!

821
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:25,364
Sorry, Tigress!

822
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:27,229
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

823
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,110
Sorry!

824
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,036
Shifu.

825
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:45,708
Bring them to me.

826
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,265
No.

827
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:58,556
You must warn Po.

828
00:49:58,598 --> 00:49:59,598
Master, please.

829
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:11,744
I will show you
the true power of chi, brother.

830
00:50:14,072 --> 00:50:15,072
No.

831
00:50:51,026 --> 00:50:53,526
Oogway, forgive me.

832
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,780
What do you say, Oogway?

833
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:59,494
Do you forgive him?

834
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,787
You may have destroyed the Jade Palace...

835
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,669
but you will never succeed.

836
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:09,667
There will always be someone to stop you.

837
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:11,751
Who? The panthe?

838
00:51:11,797 --> 00:51:13,797
His chi is strong...

839
00:51:14,508 --> 00:51:15,548
but it will not be enough.

840
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:20,637
He will meet the same fate as you.

841
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:21,681
No.

842
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:25,062
And so will every panthe in that village.

843
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,691
Yes.

844
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:39,567
Po, I hope you are ready.

845
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:45,207
Dance, Lotus. Dance.

846
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,962
he is so handsome.

847
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:51,709
Hi!

848
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,712
that is a panthe hug!

849
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:55,474
Hey.

850
00:52:00,512 --> 00:52:01,512
Po.

851
00:52:38,342 --> 00:52:39,342
Tigress?

852
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:43,886
who is she?

853
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,100
Who is that?

854
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:48,269
Big Stripy Baby!

855
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:51,192
What are you doing here?

856
00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:52,979
Kai attacked the Valley.

857
00:52:53,023 --> 00:52:55,733
he is taken every master in China,
including Shifu and the others.

858
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:58,856
it is all gone, Po.
Everything. Everyone.

859
00:52:58,904 --> 00:52:59,904
Everyone?

860
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,030
Everyone.

861
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,413
how is my restaurant?

862
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:06,335
we will talk later.

863
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,830
And now he is on his way here.

864
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:09,371
he is after you, Po.

865
00:53:09,957 --> 00:53:11,617
he is after all pandas.

866
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:13,746
How long do we have?

867
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:14,754
Not long.

868
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:16,925
Please, tell me you have mastered chi.

869
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:18,384
- Here, take the baby.
- Dad! Dad!

870
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:19,593
Okay, who belongs to this one?

871
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:21,593
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

872
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:23,805
No, no, I am afraid you need more time.

873
00:53:24,554 --> 00:53:26,264
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

874
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,096
I do not have more time.
I need to learn it now!

875
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,101
Sorry, you are not ready.

876
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:31,443
Okay, pack everything!

877
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:32,978
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

878
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,610
What are you talking about?
I have done everything you have asked.

879
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:38,779
I have mastered napping, sleeping in,
hammocks, hot tubs.

880
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:42,029
I am totally at one with my panthe parts.
Now why will not you show me?

881
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:44,162
Because I do not know it!

882
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,454
You what?

883
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,955
I do not know it, okay?
No one does.

884
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:52,078
Maybe we used to.

885
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,420
But not anymore.

886
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:55,965
You lied?

887
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:57,343
No, I...

888
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,416
Yes.

889
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:02,718
Why?

890
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:04,469
To save your life!

891
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:08,061
I find out some blade-swinging maniac
is coming for you.

892
00:54:08,098 --> 00:54:11,308
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

893
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:15,901
Yes! I am the Dragon Warrior.
Facing maniacs, that is my job!

894
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:19,399
But because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

895
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:21,323
I left my friends unprotected!

896
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,701
And now they are all...

897
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:24,323
they are all...

898
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:26,204
And you would have been, too.

899
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:29,828
I lost you once.

900
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:32,250
I am not going to lose you again.

901
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:35,045
I cannot.

902
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:42,297
You just did.

903
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:55,147
Mom! Pick me!

904
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:04,197
Po, I am so worried for you...

905
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:06,907
that I cannot even enjoy
being right about everything.

906
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:09,869
Now run, run, run,
as fast as those chubby legs can go!

907
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,410
Run? there is nowhere to run.

908
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:13,203
But what are you going to do?

909
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:16,116
I am going to stay, and fight that monster.

910
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:19,586
Po, he may be a monster,
but he is still your father.

911
00:55:19,628 --> 00:55:21,128
Not him. Kai!

912
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:23,045
No!

913
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,300
Hungry?

914
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:11,394
No, I... Not really.

915
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,719
Well, maybe just one.

916
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:18,688
You know, you were not the only one
who was lying.

917
00:56:18,729 --> 00:56:19,599
Oh?

918
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:23,646
I did not really come along
because I was worried Po would go hungry.

919
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:25,824
I was worried about you.

920
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:27,856
Worried that I would go hungry?

921
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:29,244
No.

922
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,781
I was worried you would steal Po from me.

923
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:32,775
I would what?

924
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,786
I know. That was crazy.

925
00:56:36,246 --> 00:56:41,956
But I realize having you in Pofs life
does not mean less for me.

926
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:44,302
It means more for Po.

927
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:49,933
Well, I am not in his life.

928
00:56:49,968 --> 00:56:51,178
Not anymore.

929
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,890
Your son got mad at you.

930
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,430
Welcome to parenthood.

931
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:58,484
You do not understand. I lied to him.

932
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:00,521
he shall never forgive me.

933
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:02,982
I lied to him for 20 years.

934
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:05,113
He still thinks he came from an egg.

935
00:57:05,817 --> 00:57:10,447
Sometimes, we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

936
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:19,624
Look.

937
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:21,465
he is hurt.

938
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,960
he is confused.

939
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:26,842
And he still has to save the world.

940
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,760
He needs both his dads.

941
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:49,857
This is not going to work.

942
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,033
It has to.

943
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:52,161
you are not thinking straight.

944
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:53,567
- I am!
- you are not.

945
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:54,735
- I am!
- No.

946
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:55,783
- Yes, I am.
- No.

947
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,790
I have seen Kai.

948
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,578
I have seen what he can do.

949
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:01,751
But he has not seen what I can do.

950
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:07,129
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

951
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:09,009
it is my best move.

952
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,837
I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

953
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:12,973
Back to the Spirit Realm.

954
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,430
He has an army of jade warriors.

955
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:19,310
Everything they see, he sees.
So there is no sneaking up on him.

956
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:20,809
You will never get close enough.

957
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:21,851
it is going to work!

958
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:26,862
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

959
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:29,107
You sound just like Shifu
with the, "Chi, chi, chi."

960
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:31,111
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

961
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:33,403
I am not a master of chi, okay?

962
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:36,487
I do not know if I am the Dragon Warrior.
I do not even know if I am a panthe!

963
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:37,993
I do not know who I am!

964
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:41,831
you are right.

965
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:44,002
there is no way I can stop him and his army.

966
00:58:48,378 --> 00:58:50,878
Unless you had an army of your own.

967
00:58:54,217 --> 00:58:55,217
You?

968
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,471
Not just me.

969
00:58:57,512 --> 00:58:59,012
Us.

970
00:58:59,056 --> 00:59:00,346
All of us.

971
00:59:09,566 --> 00:59:13,486
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

972
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:16,816
it is going to take a lot more
than the end of the world...

973
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:18,065
to keep us apart.

974
00:59:18,116 --> 00:59:20,156
But you do not even know kung fu.

975
00:59:20,202 --> 00:59:22,622
Then you will teach us.

976
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:25,423
What? I cannot teach you kung fu.

977
00:59:25,457 --> 00:59:30,497
I could not even teach Tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

978
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:36,008
Po, I know I am the last guy
you want to trust right now.

979
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:38,433
But you have got to believe me.

980
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,180
We can do this.

981
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:42,312
We can learn kung fu.

982
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,929
We can be just like you!

983
00:59:46,103 --> 00:59:47,103
What did you just say?

984
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,610
- "We can do this"?
- No!

985
00:59:50,274 --> 00:59:51,794
- "We can learn kung fu"?
- After that!

986
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:53,531
"We can be just like you"?

987
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:55,028
- Yes!
- We can?

988
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,610
No! You cannot!

989
00:59:58,115 --> 00:59:59,455
But you do not have to be!

990
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:02,162
that is what Shifu meant.

991
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:05,292
I do not have to turn you into me.
I have to turn you into you!

992
01:00:06,498 --> 01:00:08,168
That does not make any sense.

993
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,498
I know!

994
01:00:10,252 --> 01:00:11,672
Thanks, Dads.

995
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,172
- you are welcome?
- you are welcome?

996
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:16,223
I am going to do something
I never thought I would be able to do.

997
01:00:16,258 --> 01:00:18,468
I am going to teach kung fu.

998
01:00:20,554 --> 01:00:24,354
You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best "you" you can be.

999
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:25,601
So who are you?

1000
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:27,192
What are you good at?

1001
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:28,597
What do you love?

1002
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:30,055
What makes you, "you"?

1003
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:35,574
Yes, good. Good. Again.

1004
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:39,912
Good. Again.

1005
01:00:40,657 --> 01:00:42,327
Good, good, good. Again.

1006
01:00:43,994 --> 01:00:46,124
Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!

1007
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:50,041
Faster, faster! Twirl those ribbons!

1008
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,463
Hug that log, you!

1009
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:55,131
Hug that log like it is the last time
you are ever going to hug it goodbye forever.

1010
01:00:55,172 --> 01:00:57,972
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time. You can do it!

1011
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:03,641
I do not want to see any of these
hit the ground!

1012
01:01:14,816 --> 01:01:16,936
Wait, wait, Stripy Baby!

1013
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,495
Good! Try it with this.

1014
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,698
Now try it with these!

1015
01:01:27,788 --> 01:01:29,958
Good! Now try it with these.

1016
01:02:04,574 --> 01:02:05,994
They are ready.

1017
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:10,214
What?

1018
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:14,209
Okay, pay attention because I am only
going to go over this ten more times.

1019
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:17,131
The only entrance to the village is here.

1020
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,630
The dumpling squadron
will take position here...

1021
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:22,303
while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

1022
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:24,842
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

1023
01:02:27,222 --> 01:02:28,812
Right, okay.

1024
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,679
The noodle squadron will...

1025
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:39,442
Okay. Anyway, the important thing to
remember is that this is the spot where...

1026
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:44,316
Okay, I saw that coming.

1027
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:47,374
If you only remember one thing,
it is distract the jombies...

1028
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:50,369
until I get close enough
to put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai.

1029
01:02:50,412 --> 01:02:52,212
- You got it?
- Yeah!

1030
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:55,496
Pandas on three!
One, two three, Pan-...!

1031
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:58,882
You guys...
Never mind, I will teach you that later.

1032
01:03:34,414 --> 01:03:37,464
I wish I could have taught you this, son.

1033
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,251
it is okay, Dad. I am...

1034
01:03:45,926 --> 01:03:47,586
he is here.

1035
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:13,792
Wow!

1036
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:16,538
that is what I call
a Dramatic Entrance!

1037
01:04:21,044 --> 01:04:23,634
You must be the Dragon Warrior.

1038
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:26,422
And you must be Kai!

1039
01:04:26,466 --> 01:04:28,966
Beast of Vengeance, Maker of Widows!

1040
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,600
Yes! Finally! Thank you!

1041
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,520
Almost makes me want to spare your life.

1042
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:37,019
Oh, you want to spare me?

1043
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,310
How about you spare me the chit-chat?
All right? let us do this.

1044
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:43,436
I am going to take your chi...

1045
01:04:43,483 --> 01:04:46,283
then the chi of every panthe in the...

1046
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,530
Chit-chat!

1047
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:49,161
- In this...
- Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1048
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:50,487
- In...
- Chat, chat, chat.

1049
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:52,495
- In the...
- Chit-chat!

1050
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:55,327
You pudgy little...

1051
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,330
Round them all up.

1052
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:17,479
Oh, no. it is true.

1053
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:19,517
You guys have all been turned green!

1054
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:22,441
Except for you, Mantis.
You were already green.

1055
01:05:24,524 --> 01:05:25,864
- Now?
- Wait for the signal.

1056
01:05:28,403 --> 01:05:29,533
Here we go!

1057
01:05:40,457 --> 01:05:41,707
Dumpling Squad!

1058
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,670
- Ready?
- Go time!

1059
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,300
- Belly!
- Gong!

1060
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:50,009
Seriously?

1061
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,090
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1062
01:05:52,302 --> 01:05:53,552
Sorry, Crane.

1063
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:04,231
Spring Roll Squad!
Time for some takeout!

1064
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:14,573
Over here, Mr. Jombie!

1065
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:22,117
I do not know who you are, either.

1066
01:06:22,582 --> 01:06:23,582
Noodle Squad!

1067
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:28,877
Get ready to dance...

1068
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:30,472
with danger!

1069
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:35,761
Sweet!

1070
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:48,818
Stripy Baby!

1071
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:49,859
Oh, no.

1072
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:55,993
- Do it.
- you are mean!

1073
01:07:01,872 --> 01:07:03,792
Fire!

1074
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,375
Fire in the hole!

1075
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,515
Yes!

1076
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,339
All right, kids!

1077
01:07:14,384 --> 01:07:15,724
You got it, guys!

1078
01:07:19,514 --> 01:07:20,854
Oh, no! Master Shifu!

1079
01:07:22,643 --> 01:07:23,643
I cannot hit Shifu!

1080
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:27,114
I can!

1081
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:28,727
And so can I.

1082
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:32,275
Double-Dad Defense!

1083
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,609
- Left, Dad!
- Right, Dad!

1084
01:07:33,654 --> 01:07:34,784
Thanks, Dad!

1085
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:36,161
Back at you, Dad.

1086
01:07:36,198 --> 01:07:37,738
we have got this, son!

1087
01:07:38,575 --> 01:07:39,775
Go, Dads!

1088
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:40,826
Yeah!

1089
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,247
Yeah!

1090
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:46,924
We got them now.

1091
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:49,919
Stop. Stop! Enough!

1092
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:53,212
Get out...

1093
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,724
let us finish this.

1094
01:08:00,847 --> 01:08:01,847
that is our boy!

1095
01:08:17,531 --> 01:08:20,581
Sorry, buddy.
have got to send you back to the Spirit Realm.

1096
01:08:20,617 --> 01:08:21,697
Skadoosh!

1097
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,830
Okay, that did not work.
Let me try one more time.

1098
01:08:26,873 --> 01:08:30,593
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... What the...?

1099
01:08:30,627 --> 01:08:32,667
Hold on, wait! it is working.

1100
01:08:32,713 --> 01:08:34,713
No. No!

1101
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:41,678
No, it is not.

1102
01:08:41,722 --> 01:08:43,392
Did Oogway teach you that little trick?

1103
01:08:44,057 --> 01:08:45,387
Too bad.

1104
01:08:45,434 --> 01:08:47,694
It only works on mortals.

1105
01:08:47,728 --> 01:08:51,558
And I am a Spirit Warrior.

1106
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:52,607
Come!

1107
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:39,278
Son!

1108
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Po!

1109
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:44,623
I was wrong.

1110
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,700
I am sorry. Run. Run!

1111
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:01,305
So, Oogway...

1112
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:05,263
this was the one destined to stop me?

1113
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:07,465
I will have his chi...

1114
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:10,235
and then all of theirs!

1115
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:26,869
And you...

1116
01:10:29,413 --> 01:10:33,173
You really thought you could
send me back to the Spirit Realm?

1117
01:10:39,214 --> 01:10:41,344
You are just a   mortal.

1118
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:44,676
It only works on mortals.

1119
01:10:47,055 --> 01:10:49,175
you are right. I cannot send you there.

1120
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:52,016
But I can take you there.

1121
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:53,519
what is that?

1122
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:56,355
What?

1123
01:10:56,565 --> 01:10:58,025
- Po!
- Son!

1124
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,194
Skadoosh.

1125
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:01,235
- Son!
- Son!

1126
01:11:02,195 --> 01:11:03,195
No!

1127
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:26,845
What happened?

1128
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:27,887
where is Po?

1129
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:31,678
He took Kai away. He saved us.

1130
01:11:31,725 --> 01:11:32,895
No.

1131
01:11:34,603 --> 01:11:37,653
He saved us, but who is saving him?

1132
01:11:42,235 --> 01:11:43,695
Whoa!

1133
01:11:43,737 --> 01:11:45,947
The Spirit Realm. It worked!

1134
01:11:46,573 --> 01:11:48,243
Get off me, you...

1135
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,409
You brought me back?

1136
01:11:51,912 --> 01:11:54,542
do not blame me.
I tried to finish this in the regular realm.

1137
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:56,751
Then we will finish it here!

1138
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:33,544
Come on, son. Fight!

1139
01:12:40,544 --> 01:12:42,134
We have to help him.

1140
01:12:42,879 --> 01:12:44,089
We have to help him!

1141
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,261
Okay. Everyone gather around.

1142
01:12:45,299 --> 01:12:47,679
that is it. Come in close. Come on.

1143
01:12:47,718 --> 01:12:49,388
We can do this.

1144
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:58,564
Po...

1145
01:12:58,604 --> 01:13:01,824
You taught us
who we were meant to be.

1146
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,609
A father.

1147
01:13:11,408 --> 01:13:12,738
A friend.

1148
01:13:13,327 --> 01:13:14,617
A dumpling kicker.

1149
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:16,371
A lethal fighting machine.

1150
01:13:16,413 --> 01:13:17,663
A hugger.

1151
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,505
A nunchuck chick.

1152
01:13:21,835 --> 01:13:23,795
Stripy Baby.

1153
01:13:24,838 --> 01:13:26,338
A family.

1154
01:13:56,161 --> 01:13:57,371
Sweet!

1155
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:07,627
Whoa.

1156
01:14:13,053 --> 01:14:14,473
Who are you?

1157
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:16,893
I have been asking the same question.

1158
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:23,315
Am I the son of a panthe?

1159
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:25,195
The son of a goose?

1160
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:26,322
A studid not?

1161
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:28,494
A teacher?

1162
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:31,146
Turns out...

1163
01:14:31,905 --> 01:14:33,025
I am all of them.

1164
01:14:41,873 --> 01:14:45,383
I am the Dragon Warrior.

1165
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:48,511
Get it? See the giant dragon?

1166
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,215
Get ready to feel the thunder.

1167
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:54,429
This is awesome!

1168
01:15:12,738 --> 01:15:13,738
a-oh.

1169
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:21,537
Belly Gong.

1170
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:24,123
  Slap.

1171
01:15:27,586 --> 01:15:28,746
Perhaps a bit of lunch.

1172
01:15:28,795 --> 01:15:29,875
Because I am starving.

1173
01:15:49,775 --> 01:15:50,785
let us do this!

1174
01:15:55,447 --> 01:15:56,447
Heads up!

1175
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:15,508
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

1176
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:19,100
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

1177
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:20,387
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1178
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,140
Chit-chat.

1179
01:16:32,818 --> 01:16:34,818
You want my chi so bad...

1180
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:36,359
then take it.

1181
01:16:43,412 --> 01:16:44,872
Yes.

1182
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:47,503
The power is mine.

1183
01:16:50,043 --> 01:16:52,673
Wait. No. it is too much.

1184
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:54,923
that is too much! No!

1185
01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:00,599
No!

1186
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:14,066
Where did he go?

1187
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,330
we are back!

1188
01:17:23,368 --> 01:17:24,238
Bestie!

1189
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:26,076
I am still green! It did not work!

1190
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:28,041
Oh, wait. that is my normal green.

1191
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:29,541
Greeny Baby!

1192
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,843
Not a baby. Not a baby!

1193
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,127
Antenna of Fear!

1194
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,090
What about Po?

1195
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,130
Have you seen Po?

1196
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:37,803
No. he is not here?

1197
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:41,008
Po? Po?

1198
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:42,933
Why is not he back?

1199
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:55,325
Dragon Warrior.

1200
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:56,649
Oogway?

1201
01:18:00,989 --> 01:18:02,029
I cannot believe it.

1202
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:03,579
Whoa!

1203
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:05,237
You are extra shiny.

1204
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:06,405
As are you.

1205
01:18:06,453 --> 01:18:08,373
I know, right?
it is like the best cape ever.

1206
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:10,713
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1207
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:13,039
It suits you. you have grown.

1208
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:15,135
Yep. I have got to lay off the panthe buffet.

1209
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,500
Grown up...

1210
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:22,223
as I hoped you would
when I sent the message to your father.

1211
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:25,641
You sent the universe mail. Whoa!

1212
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:26,681
Yes.

1213
01:18:27,224 --> 01:18:30,024
Because the universe needed you.

1214
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,060
Me?

1215
01:18:32,396 --> 01:18:36,896
You finally became the panthe
you were always meant to be.

1216
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:39,112
But, how did you know I could?

1217
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:41,572
On the first day we met...

1218
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:44,953
I saw the future of kung fu.

1219
01:18:47,577 --> 01:18:49,407
And the past.

1220
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:55,669
I saw the panthe
who could unite them both.

1221
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,666
That is why I chose you, Po.

1222
01:18:59,339 --> 01:19:02,379
Both sides of a you in and Yang.

1223
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:07,392
And my true successor.

1224
01:19:09,474 --> 01:19:12,144
Me? I cannot take that.

1225
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:15,265
Just take it. I have a bigger one.

1226
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:20,439
I mean, you are enlightened and everything.
I am just...

1227
01:19:22,946 --> 01:19:24,066
Really?

1228
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:25,324
Yes.

1229
01:19:35,792 --> 01:19:37,132
Now what do we do?

1230
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,420
You tell me.

1231
01:19:40,505 --> 01:19:42,465
No. Oogway, do not go!

1232
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:46,087
I am not going anywhere. I live here.

1233
01:19:46,136 --> 01:19:47,466
Oh, right.

1234
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:52,637
it is you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1235
01:19:52,684 --> 01:19:54,694
Wait. I can go back?

1236
01:19:54,728 --> 01:19:57,728
Who knows? I have never tried.

1237
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,287
Wow!

1238
01:20:24,424 --> 01:20:25,594
Po!

1239
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:28,433
You can fly!

1240
01:20:34,226 --> 01:20:35,846
Dad. Dad.

1241
01:20:35,894 --> 01:20:36,904
Dads!

1242
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:38,229
- Son!
- Son!

1243
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:44,111
do not you go disappearing in petals
ever again.

1244
01:20:44,152 --> 01:20:45,742
We thought we lost you.

1245
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:47,819
No, you saved me.

1246
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,740
You all did.

1247
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,874
Now, come on over here!

1248
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,830
Hugs!

1249
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:00,706
Master Shifu!

1250
01:21:01,044 --> 01:21:05,554
The studid not has truly become the tea-...
Wait. Where did you get that?

1251
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:08,720
Oh, this. Oogway gave it to me
in the Spirit Realm.

1252
01:21:09,594 --> 01:21:11,184
Of course he did.

1253
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,181
I think I mastered chi.

1254
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:17,017
Oh, of course you did.

1255
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:20,365
Can you teach me?

1256
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:24,653
Ready!

1257
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,379
Whoa!

1258
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:54,683
Monkey, help me!

1259
01:21:54,723 --> 01:21:56,313
Greeny Baby!

1260
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,680
Get them off me!

1261
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:05,858
Hello.

1262
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,580
Skadoosh.

1263
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:27,132
Panthe asthmom.
