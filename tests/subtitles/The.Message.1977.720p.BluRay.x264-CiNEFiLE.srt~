1
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,873
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most Merciful

2
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:17,507
From Muhammad, the Messenger of God
to Heraclius,

3
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:22,444
the emperor of Byzantium, greetings to him
who is the follower of righteous guys

4
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:25,579
I bid you to hear the divine call

5
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:33,283
I am the messenger of God to the people,
accept Islam for yourself

6
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:38,184
He speaks of the new prophet in Arabia

7
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:41,585
Was it like this when John, the Baptist

8
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:45,341
came to king Hsrul out of the desert crying of salvation

9
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,757
To Mephocus, Patriarch of Alexandria

10
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:30,542
Kisra, emperor of Persia
Muhammad calls you with the call of God

11
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:36,244
accept Islam for your salvation
Embrace Islam

12
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:44,739
You come out of the desert, smelling of camel and goat
You stand as Persia kneel?

13
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,522
Muhammad, Messenger of God
Who gave him this authority?

14
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:02,743
God sent Muhammad as
a message to mankind

15
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,283
The Scholars and Historians of Islam -
The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo,

16
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:07,520
The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon
Have approved the accuracy and fidelity of this film

17
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,188
The makers of this film honour the Islamic Tradition

18
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,554
which holds that the Impersonation of the Prophet

19
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:16,724
offends againts the spirituality of his message

20
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:28,333
Therefore, the person of Muhammad
will not be shown

21
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,266
600 years after Christ died,

22
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,600
when Europe was sunk in the dark ages
and everywhere

23
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:45,404
the old civilizations were falling,
Muhammad was born in Mecca in Arabia

24
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:50,974
Mecca was then a rich trading city
ruled by its merchants

25
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,538
whose wealth was multiplied by a
unique privilege They housed the gods

26
00:05:56,644 --> 00:06:01,745
Every year, at the time of the great fair,
the desert priests brought their idols

27
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:05,626
and the images of their gods into the custody of Kabbaah

28
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:41,063
Months, the most holyish reign of Abraham,
the Kabbaah has now

29
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:48,392
become a house of idology hosting
no fewer than 360 different gods

30
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:53,195
Mecca in 610 AD

31
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,372
Bilal!

32
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:36,256
Have the other days counted Umaya?

33
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:39,124
Not yet But this year the Gods are gold

34
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,358
When you put the Gods and Prophet together,
its a pretty bit deal

35
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:48,218
Oh, more Gods in the place of Kabbaah

36
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:54,350
Caravans from Syria

37
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,085
mm They must be in running Very thirsty

38
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,834
Put 5 more men in North Wells

39
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,535
How many sheeps will I have to kill for them? 70?

40
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,836
Give them a 100

41
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:09,170
Macca should keep her name
for hospitality

42
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:13,630
And 10 lambs for the leaders

43
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,711
Bread and water, do the poets have in the Hakim's house

44
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:31,071
Where verse and prose are nightly
put to slaughter

45
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:40,507
And and the bread, I swear in there,
is thinner than the water

46
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,621
Oh, open the space Open the space,
you lovers of poetry

47
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:48,522
to Abu Sufian, willing and which

48
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:51,057
patron of the art

49
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:59,361
When Abu Sufian invites the poet in, there joy is
kids and love is kin

50
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:03,296
where wines and cakes abound
the skills of Abu Sufian

51
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:12,900
All revels and all songs begin
when Abu Sufian invites the poet in

52
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,108
Roman silk, worms of China, my lady,

53
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:37,973
a pleasure to the lin, and as my lady can see,
ravish to the eyes

54
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,974
Yes 7 lengths
20 dinars

55
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:49,538
Abu Sufian's wife? 15!

56
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:15,763
Oh, gold!
the gods of the Kabbaah have their needs

57
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:18,118
They are Acives

58
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:32,727
Who is that man who stood there,
who looked into my soul?

59
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,655
Cut me away from here

60
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,342
Why did Muhammad come down here?

61
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,343
Why don't you stop him?

62
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,376
He is your nephew

63
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,711
Maybe he will change!

64
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,360
Change?

65
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,783
He is 40 years old
Its unnatural, with a rich wife he could afford the best of Mecca

66
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:01,317
If he chooses to sit shivering in a cave,

67
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,184
it is unnatural

68
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:05,952
For a man who dares to risk the anger of

69
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:12,712
Lath-Uzza, who keeps our health,
Mannat, the god of our prosperity,

70
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:20,793
Allot, the god of our family and tribes
and Hubar,

71
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:23,726
Hubar, who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate

72
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:27,529
To challenge the gods within a year
sort of the gods is dangerous

73
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,663
Unreasonable

74
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:30,964
Rebellious, blasphemous

75
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:36,927
Yes, I'm afraid Muhammad will harm himself

76
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:52,373
I am always sad
when the great fair is over

77
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:56,629
I might not see the next one

78
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,766
Abu Talib! Abu Talib!

79
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:06,713
Catch your breath, Zaid!

80
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:09,348
Has Muhammad come down from the mountain yet?

81
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:10,948
He's been there for 3 days

82
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:15,651
No No, I haven't seen him

83
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,185
Khadija hoped he might have come to you
on his way home

84
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:22,019
Maybe he's still up there

85
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,674
3 days

86
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:36,854
I'm afraid for him on the mountain
because I don't know what it means

87
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:42,787
Men see the world too well from a mountain

88
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,364
Muhammad! Read!

89
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:23,649
In the name of the Lord who created
man from his sensitive drop of blood

90
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,384
teaches man what he knows not

91
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:31,673
Read!

92
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:15,606
He's still trembling under the blanket, but he has spoken

93
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:21,000
Zaid! What happened to my nephew on the mountain?

94
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:33,411
He was alone in the cave
Suddenly an angel came on to him,

95
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:40,751
The angel said: Read!
Muhammad replied: I can not read

96
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:48,054
The angle commanded again: Read!

97
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:53,324
In the name of our Lord
who created man from his sensitive drop of blood

98
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:59,326
who teaches man what he knows not: Read!

99
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,028
Who knows if it was Gabriel!

100
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:09,024
It could have been a dream

101
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,633
When Muhammad was coming from the mountain
He saw Gabriel cleanly

102
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:17,101
in the shape of a man
standing on the horizon

103
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:22,769
Wherever he looked, upon every turn of his head
he saw him

104
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:38,886
Gabriel said to him again: I am Gabriel and
you Muhammad are the Messenger of God

105
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,981
Who has he told about this?

106
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,015
His Wife

107
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,882
and Ali

108
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:53,485
And his friend Abu Bakr

109
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,119
And you?

110
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,681
I am his adopted son

111
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,612
Be careful to whom you talk

112
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:10,560
Tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child will protect him still

113
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:15,028
After all, they say the God of Moses

114
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:20,080
spoke to him under the burning bush

115
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,067
If you do not restrain your nephew, then we will

116
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,702
He's dividing the city, heart against hopes
He's dividing the generations,

117
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:33,637
child against parent

118
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:39,805
The young are listening to him, he attract the yound

119
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:47,502
We are Arabs We obey our fathers
Our children cannot be our teachers

120
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,343
How can we accept that
the man we met in the street yesterday

121
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:54,147
can be some God's Prophet today?

122
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:57,648
Dead ones can live again, he says

123
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,116
because he who created man

124
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,651
can also make man return from the dead, he says

125
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:08,545
The Gods might leave us and
give their benefits to another city

126
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:19,892
Tell him we will give him authority, position,
and key to the Kabbaah,

127
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,916
and money what money he wants

128
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:29,350
Tell him we will give him anything he wants

129
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:57,474
Muhammad, spare yourself and me

130
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:03,369
Do not put a great burden on
an old man who can't bear

131
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,514
In your childhood, you were in my arms,

132
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:17,619
I cannot see you hurt
If you refuse them, they will hurt you

133
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,124
He said this to me:

134
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:38,791
Were they to put sun in my right hand
and the moon in my left

135
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:44,356
I would not renounce my message
which is from God

136
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,001
When I am dead, you may do as you please

137
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,234
but last time in your life,
you will believe your father

138
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,035
Why did you hurt your father?

139
00:18:55,036 --> 00:19:02,838
If I'd be drunk every day and played dice
every night, you'd call it high spirits

140
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,738
You'll be more my brother than you are now

141
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,267
You are all my children

142
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:20,813
I give you everything I could, but it seems
not to be enough

143
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:26,216
Muhammad gives me more, he give all the world more

144
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:29,071
Get him out of here father!

145
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:43,523
Its not worth it He's our father

146
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:46,379
You torture him

147
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,789
Wait Hudaifa, wait

148
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,899
How can they say its an invention, Musab

149
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,202
when it isn't new?

150
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,469
In Mecca it's new

151
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,499
If God has said it all before, to Noah, Moses, Jesus, to all of Prophets,
but people changed it, turned it, forgot it

152
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:25,872
Now God said it to Muhammad again,
and it is new again

153
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,401
What is it?

154
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:31,864
It Jafar

155
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,935
What have you brought with you?

156
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:50,339
The very word of God

157
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,394
When the sun is overthrown

158
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:03,061
when the stars fall

159
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,896
when the mountains vanish

160
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:10,131
when the camels bid with yound abandoned

161
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,165
When the wild beasts are herded together

162
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,066
when the seas rise

163
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,901
When the souls are sorted

164
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,771
when the female infant who is buried alive

165
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,905
asks for what crime she was killed

166
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:29,140
when the books are opened

167
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:32,408
when the sky is torn away,

168
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:40,112
then every soul will know what it has done

169
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:47,701
You were there Jafar when God
gave him these words?

170
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,707
Dawn is coming up

171
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,122
Ammar you first, then you Jafar

172
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:20,791
Ammar, you keep your mother awake
all night with worry

173
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:21,991
I am sorry father

174
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:22,426
Where were you?

175
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:26,021
Have you been with Muhammad again?

176
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,484
What will happen now?

177
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,899
Forgive him It was my fault, I did it

178
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,366
That God has helped us all our lives

179
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:45,101
If it fell, it could not help itself

180
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:47,704
What talks have you been listening to?

181
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:54,739
The real god is unseen,
he's not made of clay

182
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,743
Ammar, we see the Gods in the Kabbaah every day

183
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:05,396
I am afraid for you

184
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:10,666
You are listening to people who will hurt you

185
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,948
I'm listening to Muhammad, mother

186
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:17,685
Muhammad is generous, yes He gives, he shares,

187
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:24,183
he pass no man without a smile,
but he is spreading dangerous ideas

188
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:27,839
Dangerous ideas that no man should start

189
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:31,591
that the rich should not afload the poor,

190
00:24:31,592 --> 00:24:36,302
the strong should not oppress the weak
Are these dangerous ideas?

191
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,260
Girls should not be forced into marriage,

192
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:41,547
but be able to choose or refuse

193
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,598
But only tonight, he said to stop

194
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,123
the burial of new-born girls

195
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:53,727
I was fortunate, always fortunate with your mother

196
00:24:54,336 --> 00:25:00,161
Yes, but you know that you and I nearly never met Yassar

197
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:04,129
and you were nearly never born

198
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:10,675
I was to be buried
like my 2 sisters

199
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:16,172
but my father couldnt' do it
He couldn't do it at that time

200
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:23,168
When the second girl was buried,

201
00:25:25,382 --> 00:25:29,980
when my father was putting sand over her,

202
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:38,522
finger raised him as do babies,
told her mother afterwards

203
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:45,692
she took hold of his finger the way baby does
He told my mother afterwards, that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased

204
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:50,744
and he had taken away his hand

205
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:59,030
When I was born, my father ran out of the house

206
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:01,366
screaming that he couldn't do it again,

207
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:04,449
that he could never do it again

208
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:08,568
Sumaya, it is the custom

209
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:16,240
But it is wrong
The Gods that let such things be are no Gods

210
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:21,074
I promised to go to Muhammad's house mama
and pray there

211
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:25,466
Yes! He is a good man

212
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:34,566
Yes, yes, you go

213
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,338
Two men are following him

214
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:56,723
Read?
Muhammad can neither write nor read

215
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:57,925
Muhammad can speak

216
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:01,193
What did you say?

217
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:06,929
He can speak? Well, so can you
So now, you speak up yound man

218
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,096
What does Muhammad say umm?

219
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:12,817
They are God's words, not his

220
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,532
Which god's? What words?
A speaking god?

221
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:26,661
Your Muhammad speaks only to himself

222
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:31,074
When god reveals his message to Muhammad,

223
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,575
he remembers every word and
then he tells it to those who can write

224
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,442
It is the Qur'an

225
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:42,345
Muhammad has starved himself into dreams,
he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut

226
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:45,147
His eyes are shut but his heart is open

227
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:48,181
You! kick him for his cleverness

228
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,638
There, is no need for hasts

229
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:57,384
Doesn't Muhammad realize that we live by housing
to the Gods?

230
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,553
We own the Kabbaah

231
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:06,017
Every year, the tribes of Arabia come here
to Mecca to pray and to buy from us

232
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:11,059
Now, were we to replace 300
gods with just one?

233
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,127
whom we cannot even see, was supposed to be in Taif and Medina,

234
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:19,951
here in my house, in Jerusalem, on the moon?

235
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,885
Where would Mecca be then?

236
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:28,667
The gods are both our vision and our revenue

237
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,902
You cannot buy and sell God

238
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:35,103
Young man, you are close to be whipped

239
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,972
Ammar, be sensible boy

240
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:40,538
I have a question

241
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:46,569
Muhammad teaches you,
a slave is equal to his master

242
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,243
This black Bilal, I paid money for is equal to me?

243
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:59,107
Yes Muhammad says before God all
men are equal as the teeth of a gum

244
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:05,304
This is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars
It gives them pretensions

245
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:14,622
Bilal! Teach this man the difference between the Lord of Mecca and a slave
Take that whip

246
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:22,724
Lash his face to teach an enormous lesson

247
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:32,996
Whip him! Whip him!

248
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:35,216
Cut him!

249
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,782
Whip him!

250
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:49,720
Do it Bilal!

251
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:05,035
Obey them! They will kill you!

252
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:12,796
So you want anarchy to bring

253
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:15,363
They even infected our slaves

254
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:21,619
If you're human enough to have gods,
remember that there are gods for your owner

255
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,080
I bought humanity Bilal
when I bought you

256
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:29,805
You will be corrected

257
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,497
One, one god

258
00:30:45,498 --> 00:30:49,532
There is only one God

259
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:55,366
Who is stronger now, your master
or this one god of yours?

260
00:30:55,367 --> 00:31:01,637
One god There is only one God

261
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,605
Bring the stones

262
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:12,076
One god, One god! One god!

263
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:22,317
Crush him!

264
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,045
Are you finished with him?

265
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,156
There is only one God!

266
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:46,377
You could swear the slave was preaching!

267
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:48,849
Lord Umaya!

268
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:57,930
Abu Bakr will pay 100 dinars for this slave

269
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:58,630
Wait now!

270
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:03,298
It's against our social order
to sell a slave during his punishment

271
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,949
The offer is to Lord Umaya!

272
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:16,303
If the price of slaves is raised,
we shall have to pay ourselves next year

273
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:28,741
Take him He is no use to me anymore
Kill him or take him more I'm finished with him

274
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,746
We are declaring ourselves

275
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:38,448
God has told his messenger to declare Islam to all men

276
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:40,249
Open the windows!

277
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,104
Let the world hear

278
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,839
We are coming out of the darkness

279
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:07,628
Hear well the word of God
Hear well the messenger of Lord

280
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:15,232
There are no other Gods, but God and Muhammad is his messenger
We have come into light, join us on the way to the Kabbah

281
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:20,434
God is most great, God is most great!

282
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:25,471
God has no partner, we have come into light

283
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:30,352
Join us on the way to Kabbah

284
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:44,179
Muhammad and his rebellion called Islam
are coming out

285
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,681
to fall our gods
and de-throw our religion

286
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,447
Don't let them reach the Kabbaah

287
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:54,272
Throw them back! Defend your gods

288
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:15,293
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

289
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:28,446
Protect the prophet!
There is no gods but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God

290
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:41,763
Guards!

291
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,308
God is great!

292
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:51,942
Blasphemy! ldiot!

293
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:56,506
God is great!

294
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:23,543
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

295
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,385
Now's the time to break them,
there are only 30 of them

296
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:40,098
No! we've done enough
More will only create sympathy for them

297
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:59,595
God is great!

298
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:04,677
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

299
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:09,979
say: O you who reject faith
I worship not other

300
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,765
Get out of Kabbaah!

301
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:16,673
Silence, you'r a false prophet! Stop!

302
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,700
Back to the corner!

303
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:37,944
Hamza! Hamza!

304
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,540
You are brave

305
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:36,119
He is the bravest man in the desert
and he meets men unarmed

306
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,687
Muhammad is a liar

307
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,943
Liar? If you don't let him speak!

308
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:47,625
Where's the lie and where's the truth
when it hasn't been spoken yet?

309
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,310
Muhammad is a fraud

310
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:54,486
Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!

311
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:06,091
I affirm my nephew's religion
and I say what he says

312
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,054
Who ever has the courage to fight,
to fight with me!

313
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:50,155
Muhammed, when I hunt the desert at night,
I know that God is not kept in a house

314
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:04,526
Who'd have thought that Hamza, Hamza above all,
with his wine drinking, lion hunting

315
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:06,995
will come to join Muhammad?

316
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:12,718
More we attack, more seem to join him

317
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:15,531
Where does he find his words?

318
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:18,855
I don't know

319
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:22,435
How can an illiterate man go up on a mountain

320
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:28,170
and come back 3 days later blazing with poetry?

321
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:35,034
It wasn't just only poetry, he says it's God's

322
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:41,311
How do we fight someone
whose strength we do not understand?

323
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:47,679
Muhammad promises heaven, trees in the skies
It's natural he found audience

324
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,548
Then we must make that audience
less eager to listen to him

325
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:55,530
We will begin with the weaker ones

326
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:36,135
Have mercy!

327
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:38,422
Left hand!

328
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,157
Who is your God? Answer me!

329
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:26,625
Say it! Say who is your God?

330
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:27,558
Say it!

331
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:35,093
There is only one God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

332
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,001
Ammar!

333
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,824
Your father and mother are the first martyrs of Islam

334
00:43:48,825 --> 00:43:52,192
You are promised Paradise

335
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:14,128
How much are you men prepared to suffer?

336
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,727
The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca

337
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,073
If we stay, they will kill you
One by one

338
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:27,175
Mohamed says in Abinisia, there is a Christian King

339
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:31,751
No man is wronged in his country

340
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:39,333
We must leave now, today

341
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:15,412
Usman!

342
00:47:47,436 --> 00:47:49,016
Lord is great

343
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,989
Let us go

344
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,842
We found their tracks and followed them

345
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:08,334
But they just disappeared

346
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:14,381
They were there, in the desert, under the vultures
And you let them escape you

347
00:48:14,382 --> 00:48:17,839
Escape? They vanished!

348
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:20,983
If Muhammed has stayed, then only the weakest are gone

349
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:24,033
Weak or strong, they blacken our name

350
00:48:24,118 --> 00:48:26,520
We are honest merchants,  we buy and sell in good faith

351
00:48:26,521 --> 00:48:29,477
We cannot afford scandal

352
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:33,955
Amr!

353
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,423
You are a friend of Najjasi, the king?

354
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:37,690
Yes

355
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,273
can you use that friendship?

356
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,361
I think I can bring them back

357
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:47,137
Yes

358
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,763
Abisinia...

359
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:52,413
Rise up Amr

360
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:59,322
Please, nothing you may ask for that we will not give

361
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:05,458
Lion of Judah, I.. I don't know where to begin

362
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:10,659
you have our friendship, begin there

363
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:15,508
certain run-away slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom

364
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:20,977
Slaves go back
or you agree to return your slaves back to us

365
00:49:20,978 --> 00:49:24,800
there are however some free men among them

366
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:25,848
Rebels

367
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,599
Rebels?

368
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:31,515
If there are disagreements in Arabia,
why am I not informed?

369
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:34,599
They are rebels in religion

370
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:38,585
at one time are another
all religions were rebellions

371
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:43,088
The bodies of slaves of the world
if bidden are in-disposed

372
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:49,158
But as Jesus Christ as a shepherd,
the souls of men are his sheep

373
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,858
These are Arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers

374
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:57,428
they follow a lunatic they call.. Prophet

375
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:02,059
But I cannot put souls into chains
without hearing them

376
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:58,916
good, they'r stiff.
Next they will hang them

377
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,892
Do you not now yourself before your prophet?

378
00:51:06,893 --> 00:51:11,562
Muhammad is a man,
We kneel only to God

379
00:51:11,563 --> 00:51:14,863
Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?

380
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,765
If he were a prophet,
he'd lit the sky with miracles

381
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:26,436
indeed, this is true.
God has given his prophets signs of miracles that we may recognize them

382
00:51:26,437 --> 00:51:30,136
The miracle of Muhammad is the Holy Qur'an

383
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:35,773
A book! A book! Written by an illiterate
attributed to God

384
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:38,107
I think the emperor's heard enough

385
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:40,076
A mind full of pedicast

386
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:44,544
When God set down
tons of fire upon the heads of christ of puzzles

387
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:49,112
so that they can speak the many languages of the world
that they knew not before

388
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:54,768
But do such miracles happen in our time..

389
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:00,640
I've heard enough. You've made a poor case

390
00:52:09,557 --> 00:52:11,824
When we suffered persecution in Mecca,

391
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:13,557
Muhammad told us go to Abyssinia

392
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:16,292
the land of the righteous king,
where no man is wronged

393
00:52:16,293 --> 00:52:18,960
What they call persecution was fair punishment,

394
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,561
that is order...

395
00:52:20,562 --> 00:52:22,427
Why did your prophet send you to me?

396
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:25,263
Because you believe in the book of the one God as we do.

397
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:28,764
He sent us because
in your heart God will protect us

398
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:32,165
Talking with him is like
drawing water from a mirage

399
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:36,853
But now, they'd let the judy on me listen to them, my friend.

400
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:46,920
Go on!

401
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:55,477
For years, we worshiped wood and stone,
images of our own manufacture

402
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,778
we lived in ignorance of God

403
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:03,180
we had some earthly laws
and no heavenly laws. The rich neglect the poor.

404
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,981
And the natural pity of man

405
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,484
thereby lifts up when his brother has fallen

406
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:14,809
This is described by them as upsetting
social order

407
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:26,629
To this inhumanity has come a man
whom god chose and in that we believe

408
00:53:35,863 --> 00:53:44,065
You've overcome. I beg you to collect yourself.
I speak of the messenger of god. Muhammad teaches us to worship one god,

409
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:49,035
to speak truth
to love our neighbors as ourselves,

410
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:53,437
to give charity, even a smile can be charity

411
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:58,506
to protect women from misuse,
to shelter orphans

412
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:04,374
and to turn away from gods of Wood and stone

413
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:07,643
I cannot be still and hear this blasphemy

414
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,478
We are an ancient civilization,
to call our gods wood and stone

415
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:15,047
is to speak ignorantly of them

416
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:21,943
The idol we home is not what we worship,
but the spirit that resides within the form

417
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:27,744
I agree that idolatry is
not always fully understood Thank you

418
00:54:31,889 --> 00:54:34,778
Now, let me bring him back to the women

419
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:38,358
God made woman to be the proper companion of man

420
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,026
she is different but equal

421
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:45,561
Equal? We buy them,
feed them, perl them,

422
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:51,581
use them, distorb them,
women equal to us?

423
00:54:57,234 --> 00:55:01,488
God created man from one male and one female

424
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:07,031
Amr, you must respect the woman's womb that bore you

425
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,972
Why are you 300 guards so tongue-tied?

426
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,989
what is only god is rependent.

427
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,509
God has spoken to us before

428
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:23,073
through Abraham, Noah, Moses and through Jesus Christ.
Why should we so surprised when god speaks to us now through Muhammad?

429
00:55:25,847 --> 00:55:27,380
Who taught you those names?

430
00:55:27,381 --> 00:55:29,247
they are named in the Qur'an

431
00:55:29,248 --> 00:55:33,316
I knew Muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep

432
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:37,311
And you knew Christ as a carpenter

433
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:42,154
What Christ says and
what your Muhammad says

434
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:46,122
is like two raised from the same land

435
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:50,879
They'r lieing to you
They deny Christ You worship 3 gods they say, father son and holy ghost they'r saying

436
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:55,559
What do you say of Christ?

437
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,694
They say God can not have a son,
Christ is not the Son of God

438
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:02,915
speak to me of Christ

439
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:10,233
we say of Christ what our prophet has told us,
that god cast his holy spirit into

440
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:15,401
the womb of a virgin named Mary and that
she conceived Christ the Apostle of God

441
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:16,902
Apostol he says, not a son, not a son!

442
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:24,801
What does your miracle, your Qur'an,
say of the breadth, by the Lord Jesus Christ?

443
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:27,790
may I relate the words?

444
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,396
Come closer to me

445
00:56:39,247 --> 00:56:43,365
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

446
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:51,185
relate in the book, the story of Mary.
how she was grew away from her family

447
00:56:51,186 --> 00:56:56,755
to a place in the east.
How we sent her an angel called Gabriel who said:

448
00:56:56,756 --> 00:57:02,790
''I am a messenger from your God
to announce the birth of a holy son to you"

449
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:09,290
she said: How shall I Mary have a son when no man has touched me?''

450
00:57:10,062 --> 00:57:13,629
And Gabriel replied: For your Lord says,

451
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:19,500
it will happen"
"We appoint him as a sign on to man"

452
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:27,796
and a mercy from us!
It is a thing or didn't"

453
00:57:53,783 --> 00:58:04,185
The difference between us and you
is not bigger than this line

454
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,714
Not for a mountain of gold
will I give them up to you

455
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:22,828
you may live in Abyssinia in peace as long as you wish

456
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:28,426
May God's blessings be upon you when you return

457
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:39,702
lntolerable! Mohamed disturbs
even our foreign alliences

458
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:45,403
Very well! we will make him give up on him

459
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:50,735
Abu Talib has his arms around him

460
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:59,277
Very well!  we will throw uncle and nephew out

461
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:05,412
In one bundle, his whole family out
we will expel them from ourselves

462
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:09,248
No merchant make trade with them,
no land remain to them

463
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:11,716
no roof shelter them,
no beggar pay for them

464
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:14,684
no woman marry them

465
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:19,077
until they renounce their trend.

466
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:09,805
These were the worst years of Muhammad's life

467
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:14,246
For 3 years they suffered the hunger, thirst,

468
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:20,749
cruelty of the open desert,
but the year of grief was still to come,

469
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,617
when Khatija, Muhammad's wife for 24 years died,

470
01:00:25,618 --> 01:00:30,353
when Abu Talib his old Protector died

471
01:00:30,354 --> 01:00:37,390
With his last breath Abu Talib tried again
to reconsile Mecca and Muhammad

472
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:46,727
He never asked more from you,
when one word,

473
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:49,995
one.. one God

474
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,397
If it was only a question of one word

475
01:00:53,398 --> 01:01:00,156
I'd have given him 10 words,
but the word he wants would dethrown all the gods

476
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:26,886
You were afraid even to hear him

477
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,723
with the death of his uncle, Muhammad has now

478
01:01:48,724 --> 01:01:54,207
lost all protection
He was no longer safe in Mecca

479
01:01:54,893 --> 01:01:59,661
Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,
he went to the hillside town of Taif

480
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:04,191
He asked to be taken in, to be allowed to preach

481
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:11,495
But the children of Taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert

482
01:02:13,368 --> 01:02:15,484
What are you doing?

483
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:23,557
Stop! Stop! Leave him alone! Wait!

484
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:41,032
Muhammad called this, the bitterest day of his life

485
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,483
Then miraculously, when Muhammad's mission

486
01:02:45,484 --> 01:02:49,717
seemed to have failed, his entire situation changed

487
01:02:49,718 --> 01:02:52,985
A deputation from the rich, but self-destroying

488
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:56,954
city of Medina met him by night at the Rock of Agaba

489
01:02:56,955 --> 01:03:00,389
asking him to come to them to stand between their factions

490
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:06,318
to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars

491
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:09,426
Muhammad agreed, provided they gave him a pledge

492
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:12,994
that they worship the one God only

493
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:16,230
Wait! When we take this pledge

494
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:21,384
we expel ourselves from the rest of Arabia.
So, wait!

495
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:29,136
War is in this pledge.
We'll make enemies of brothers

496
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:34,005
we'll make firewood of our gods
That is the meaning of the pledge

497
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:38,707
If we take it, there can be no turning back

498
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:43,575
for Muhammad is indeed the messenger of God
foretold to Jews in our city

499
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:48,010
So if anyone has doubt in this pledge, go now

500
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:53,245
and if you have no doubts then you do as I do

501
01:03:55,848 --> 01:04:02,517
I pledge myself to the one and only God
and to you Muhammad, the messenger of God

502
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:07,241
He is of us and we are of him

503
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:15,353
Leave him bring his followers,
our brothers, to use, to Medina

504
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:03,512
It was a journey that changed the world

505
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:05,580
The Hijrah of flight to Medina

506
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:13,351
Only 70 people split up into small groups
walking 250 miles of desert

507
01:05:13,352 --> 01:05:18,219
yet, so profound with the consequences
so lasting with the effects of this walk

508
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,386
that from it the muslims take their calendar

509
01:05:23,422 --> 01:05:27,746
In this moment, Islam found its future

510
01:05:28,293 --> 01:05:30,626
Muhammad himself stayed in Mecca

511
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:35,997
in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely

512
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,239
Muhammad has become a nation,

513
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,608
he has received a city, entering into pledges and treaties

514
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:13,045
and you Salool who claim to be king of Medina
lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed

515
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:16,332
you should worry about yourself Abu Sufian

516
01:06:16,748 --> 01:06:21,748
Every time you trade a whif of perfume of the city,
you must creep past that man in Medina

517
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:26,651
he is across your merchantile throats as we speak

518
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,753
And what do you intend to do?

519
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:30,653
l intend to wait

520
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,154
And how long will you wait?

521
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:37,656
Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him
to save your way of life

522
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:38,956
and while you wait?

523
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:43,025
I should accept his call of course

524
01:06:43,026 --> 01:06:48,134
To think I will give him my birth-rite...
I will not..

525
01:06:49,395 --> 01:06:50,362
Medina is worth the conversion

526
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:52,410
Hypocrisy

527
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:56,591
Of course, its the healthy hypocrisy

528
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:03,761
King Salool, why put your head on the floor
5 times a day praying? I don't believe you

529
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:08,892
He may not have to.
Well, we do know we should have done it before

530
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,856
kill Muhammad

531
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:13,540
Come!
Come and see

532
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:17,193
They say that practice leads to perfection

533
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:32,014
7 young men each from a different family,
my own son Ikrima is with them

534
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:37,204
they will stab him together

535
01:07:42,488 --> 01:07:50,088
If the responsibility for his death
is shared, where lies the guilty? My idea

536
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:55,716
I'm not sure I'm part of it

537
01:07:56,293 --> 01:08:03,895
Muhammad's body contains too much
his mind, his words

538
01:08:04,618 --> 01:08:07,370
But it is an ingenious solution

539
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,563
And a final one

540
01:09:20,018 --> 01:09:21,939
No

541
01:09:22,886 --> 01:09:30,678
Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?
Who are we fighting?

542
01:09:32,953 --> 01:09:39,448
They cannot go far, all the tracks are watched
We must take to the desert

543
01:09:41,186 --> 01:09:43,619
Bakka will give 100 camels to the man

544
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,622
who brings back Muhammad
or his head

545
01:09:48,186 --> 01:09:55,319
Look for 3 of them
Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Uriqat, the Bidune guide

546
01:10:16,287 --> 01:10:17,320
What is it?

547
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:24,749
These are drains of camel
Maybe two days, that from the city

548
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:32,286
Why are you here?

549
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:33,954
Medina is to the north

550
01:10:33,955 --> 01:10:36,787
They made the tracks, not I

551
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:39,788
Know much? Traveling West?

552
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:41,753
I know my art

553
01:10:41,754 --> 01:10:45,939
They say that you can track a bird by smelling the air

554
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:50,678
we go with him

555
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:08,544
he may be in that cave over there

556
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:18,214
Muhammad, if you come out, we will
take you to Mecca alive

557
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:32,738
Muhammad, come out

558
01:11:41,024 --> 01:11:43,122
they cannot be in there
This web is unbroken

559
01:11:43,123 --> 01:11:47,365
And these pigeons
they would not build

560
01:11:47,589 --> 01:11:49,422
we were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north

561
01:11:49,423 --> 01:11:53,267
Let's move then
we still have time to head them off

562
01:12:15,424 --> 01:12:20,355
A few threads of a spider's web
was all that was then

563
01:12:20,356 --> 01:12:26,954
between Muhammad and murder
But he was a man not to be killed

564
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:32,923
The Bidune guide led him
and his companion Abu Bakr in their escape

565
01:12:32,924 --> 01:12:38,896
through untracked spaces of the desert
and the heat of the June days

566
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:42,090
At Medina, his followers waited with their welcome ready

567
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:46,675
but in great fear for his journey

568
01:13:10,959 --> 01:13:16,458
anything? No nothing

569
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:23,417
this shows that he is only a man

570
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:26,841
no man can survive that heat

571
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:57,575
There! I see them! Look!

572
01:14:32,053 --> 01:14:36,841
Run and hide! I might be obliged
to free you as a gesture

573
01:15:46,487 --> 01:15:52,585
Welcome to the city of Medina, the blessed,
your city, the messenger of god

574
01:16:03,422 --> 01:16:06,555
You will stay with me, messenger of god,
I have the best house in Medina

575
01:16:06,556 --> 01:16:09,922
you'll give me the honor of keeping you

576
01:16:09,923 --> 01:16:12,379
Stay with me!

577
01:16:14,689 --> 01:16:19,889
Please! Please! Please! How can the Prophet
choose between so many welcomes?

578
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:25,589
Where God guides his camel to stop,
there he will build his house

579
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,555
All agreed

580
01:16:26,556 --> 01:16:30,421
We turn Quaswa, his camel loose

581
01:16:30,422 --> 01:16:35,258
and where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays

582
01:16:46,656 --> 01:16:47,422
Clever man!

583
01:16:47,423 --> 01:16:51,939
A choice made by camel
can offend no one

584
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:17,477
Here we will build the house of the Prophet

585
01:18:19,092 --> 01:18:23,244
And our first meeting place,
a prayer house

586
01:18:24,193 --> 01:18:27,478
the first mosque of Islam, here!

587
01:18:28,193 --> 01:18:28,478

588
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,759
What's got the prophet to start doing it?
carrying bricks?

589
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:22,862
Give me that Look, you are doing too much,
please go and sit down we will do it

590
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:38,094
Look! He went for more

591
01:19:38,095 --> 01:19:40,328
"Work is a worship" he says

592
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:42,860
he's 53 years old

593
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,921
How old are you?

594
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:40,924
There is something missing.
Maybe a bell to call people in

595
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,381
the Christians use a bell

596
01:21:44,565 --> 01:21:46,698
what about a horn, like the Jews?

597
01:21:46,699 --> 01:21:49,188
A drum?

598
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:52,763
There's too much blood in a drum

599
01:21:52,764 --> 01:21:56,997
Why not the human voice
as in Omar bin Kattab's vision?

600
01:21:56,998 --> 01:22:00,148
The Prophet agrees?

601
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:04,363
he means you, Bilal

602
01:22:04,364 --> 01:22:06,763
me?

603
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:11,552
You have a good voice, use it!
climb up there!

604
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:58,101
Brothers, today a man of Medina
will embrace a man of Mecca

605
01:23:58,102 --> 01:24:08,601
Each will share half and half,
reach out, embrace your neighbor and brother

606
01:24:26,468 --> 01:24:28,935
I'm tired of the politics of kissing slaves

607
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:30,035
Read this

608
01:24:30,036 --> 01:24:34,323
The prophet should concern himself with the after-world

609
01:24:39,135 --> 01:24:39,901
What is my son?

610
01:24:39,902 --> 01:24:43,656
Praying like a horse

611
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:53,801
does it burn your hands?
It's not upon us to burn down the house

612
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:57,002
he's making laws like a king.
He's declared that loyalty to Islam

613
01:24:57,003 --> 01:25:01,002
is more than loyalty to tribal family

614
01:25:01,003 --> 01:25:01,269
What?

615
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:06,603
All muslims are next of kin to one-another?

616
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:11,803
Don't be mislead by that...
They must change the nature of the tribes before that

617
01:25:11,804 --> 01:25:17,369
The danger is here, the quality:
a man's neighbour is as good as himself

618
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,569
The Lunatic means it

619
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:22,568
Jews and Christians
have equal rights with Muslims,

620
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:26,336
the Jews who attach themselves to a common wealth
will be protected

621
01:25:26,337 --> 01:25:31,270
Women have rights of inheritance... Rights

622
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:33,337
Next, he will be giving the camel rights

623
01:25:33,338 --> 01:25:38,935
He has! the lunatic has!
You can't overload them

624
01:25:38,936 --> 01:25:45,237
he's remaking a city, my city...

625
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:58,571
damn him..
He's taken our sons from us, he took the children, our future from us. His rights are wrongs

626
01:25:58,572 --> 01:26:06,237
no more...
This time there will not be any regret

627
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:12,170
it will take everything of value they left in Mecca

628
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:22,329
their rugs, their houses, their silver
and with it, large of caravans to Damascus

629
01:26:53,705 --> 01:26:59,538
My friends, listen to me!
I have news from Mecca

630
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:03,839
everything you have left behind is gone

631
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:09,972
the Thieves! Abu Bakr's shops,
the prophet's house... sold

632
01:27:09,973 --> 01:27:12,872
Every cup or piece of cloth,
every rag or bone

633
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:17,615
you ever owned is thrown on the market

634
01:27:18,106 --> 01:27:25,171
You are a people of nothing.
Don't you even fight for what you own?

635
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:26,840
Who talks of the fight?

636
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:32,028
What other way is there, Hamza?

637
01:27:33,906 --> 01:27:39,072
When the Prophet says Fight!,
we fight, now he says Peace!

638
01:27:39,073 --> 01:27:40,439
Exactly

639
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:46,867
you are a peace loving people
up to your necks and fore bearers

640
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:57,062
go back to work!

641
01:28:09,009 --> 01:28:14,341
We have to defend ourselves.

642
01:28:14,342 --> 01:28:20,859
You are the Messenger of god.
Yet, they mock, abuse and plunder us and we do nothing

643
01:28:21,674 --> 01:28:24,631
In the pathage of war, we are pathetic

644
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:31,639
But they are led by greed, we are
led by god and you

645
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:41,711
I know how you hate the sword, but
we have to fight

646
01:28:46,075 --> 01:28:53,676
they've stolen our property, they are taking it to Damascus

647
01:28:53,677 --> 01:29:01,513
right past our own door our door.
I say, by God turn back

648
01:29:23,844 --> 01:29:26,562
I'm sorry I got carried away

649
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:30,859
Its pounding in my head

650
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:37,866
Please, fight them!

651
01:30:18,244 --> 01:30:21,395
But look at the sun!

652
01:30:29,578 --> 01:30:32,068
It's not the time of prayer

653
01:30:55,879 --> 01:31:01,599
It is newly revealed by god to his messenger

654
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:08,106
Fight, but fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

655
01:31:08,214 --> 01:31:10,579
Drive them out of the places from where they drove you out,

656
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:14,412
for persecution is worse than slaughter

657
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,511
Fight them until persecution is no more

658
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:25,678
and religion is God,
but if they stop, let there be no more war

659
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:30,879
for god never loves the slaughters of wars

660
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,351
so, fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

661
01:31:36,352 --> 01:31:44,120
God is great!
God is great! God is great!

662
01:32:26,515 --> 01:32:30,603
These are the disciplines that the Prophet
puts upon you

663
01:32:31,237 --> 01:32:36,960
you may not harm a woman, a child or any old person!

664
01:32:38,206 --> 01:32:41,289
you may not harm cripples

665
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,044
you may not harm the man that works in the field

666
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:48,797
You may not cut down trees

667
01:32:50,096 --> 01:32:52,941
Strike only at those who have expelled you

668
01:32:54,049 --> 01:32:58,057
who have stolen your rights and
riched themselves with your possession!

669
01:33:05,003 --> 01:33:09,365
now, to the wells of Badr

670
01:33:18,066 --> 01:33:20,579
News from Medina!

671
01:33:20,646 --> 01:33:25,819
Arms... Arm yourself... Arm yourself...

672
01:33:25,971 --> 01:33:28,963
defend your wealth

673
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:30,880
Muhammad has come out of Medina to attack the great caravan

674
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:34,086
- How many men?
-300 Two horses

675
01:33:35,619 --> 01:33:38,303
- We have more than 100 horses
How many camels?

676
01:33:38,734 --> 01:33:40,071
- 17
- We will bring 117

677
01:33:42,888 --> 01:33:44,715
- And wine,
20 of mine with wine.. we will make a feast of it

678
01:33:45,267 --> 01:33:47,025
That is a war I'd like to fight

679
01:33:47,677 --> 01:33:50,077
a war we can not lose!

680
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:37,042
ride to Abu Sufian's caravan.
tell him to turn towards Badr

681
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:39,652
We will join forces tomorrow
near sources of Beder

682
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:42,762
Wells of Badr... here

683
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:47,486
Muhammad's march... here

684
01:35:48,502 --> 01:35:52,271
my charge of the caravan.... here
One day's march...

685
01:35:55,301 --> 01:35:57,026
meet them at the wells

686
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:03,861
I don't like it

687
01:36:06,123 --> 01:36:09,526
There is too much of Mecca on my caravan to be risked

688
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:16,936
put out the fires...
hold the camels...

689
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:29,579
We are turning west, away from the wells

690
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:34,445
away?
you can't...

691
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,093
You must meet them at Badr

692
01:36:37,744 --> 01:36:40,325
we can bring them down like raw eggs

693
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:44,747
- If I run all night, I'll be out of
Muhammad's reach by morning

694
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:47,209
Where is your honor, Abu Sufian?

695
01:36:48,497 --> 01:36:50,244
Honor?

696
01:36:50,977 --> 01:36:55,807
- My honor's on the backs of my camels
Yes, I run...

697
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:50,468
Muhammad has occupied the wells

698
01:38:51,332 --> 01:38:54,358
- he has moved directly into our line of march

699
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:18,076
- Abu Sufian has broken camp
He's moving west, away from Badr

700
01:39:19,269 --> 01:39:22,946
- The Caravan is safe
So, there is no need to fight

701
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,774
not fight?

702
01:39:25,767 --> 01:39:28,690
- If we fight, we will start blood feuds between brothers

703
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:32,007
between father and son, you mean

704
01:39:32,189 --> 01:39:35,543
Hudaifa, your own son is with them.
He should have been with....

705
01:39:36,921 --> 01:39:39,877
Mecca is greater than your family

706
01:39:41,886 --> 01:39:44,218
Walid, your second son.
he is your true blood

707
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:50,941
I say: Fight! We stand in the present
and the future will look after itself

708
01:39:55,751 --> 01:39:59,138
Utbah is not a coward

709
01:40:03,284 --> 01:40:09,037
we will finish them tomorrow.
We fight! we fight!

710
01:40:46,676 --> 01:40:48,722
are you finished?

711
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,093
All right! Take your positions!

712
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:51,055
Each man to his own place

713
01:43:01,389 --> 01:43:03,020
Go back to your columns

714
01:43:03,021 --> 01:43:04,703
move it. move back

715
01:43:12,021 --> 01:43:15,085
So Muhammad's filled the wells

716
01:43:15,086 --> 01:43:18,951
Now everyone will have to fight for this

717
01:43:18,952 --> 01:43:21,271
we fight

718
01:43:32,817 --> 01:43:36,249
Brothers! we hold the wells

719
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:41,071
we stand in the name of god and his messenger.
we wait

720
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:35,823
BATTLE OF BADR......
Send us your champions

721
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,505
Who are you?

722
01:44:49,506 --> 01:44:54,759
we expect our peers and our equals

723
01:44:56,772 --> 01:44:58,816
Come back!

724
01:45:03,203 --> 01:45:12,063
my brother, Shaiba
my son Walid and myself

725
01:45:17,668 --> 01:45:27,698
Not you! Ubaida and I and Ali

726
01:46:25,223 --> 01:46:28,009
Are we your equals?

727
01:46:28,324 --> 01:46:33,645
There is only one God and
Muhammad is His messenger

728
01:48:07,975 --> 01:48:10,896
Archers! Advance!

729
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:17,394
Archers!

730
01:48:21,005 --> 01:48:28,193
Still! stretch!

731
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:40,321
stretch

732
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:53,252
stretch

733
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:09,745
Archers!

734
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:17,811
Archers back...

735
01:49:34,127 --> 01:49:36,459
they are regrouping

736
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:39,275
forward!

737
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,446
ready

738
01:49:44,659 --> 01:49:46,842
Lancers!

739
01:50:05,521 --> 01:50:08,012
God is great!

740
01:50:12,355 --> 01:50:16,903
Attack! God is great!

741
01:51:00,348 --> 01:51:03,996
Umaya!

742
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:12,468
Umaya!

743
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:15,427
Bilal!

744
01:51:46,374 --> 01:51:49,295
God is great!

745
01:52:53,430 --> 01:53:02,687
God is great!

746
01:53:09,428 --> 01:53:14,259
The Prophet is seeing you!
You are not to rob or try to perish this

747
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:22,558
And if a rogue does, cut him loose.
I said, cut them loose and give them water

748
01:53:22,559 --> 01:53:32,703
and share your food, equal mouth-fulls.
And if they walk, walk beside them

749
01:53:33,858 --> 01:53:40,943
Any prisoner who can teach 10 Muslims
to read will go free

750
01:54:08,785 --> 01:54:10,717
Why don't they go away?

751
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:15,265
Because, they blame me Hind,
whatever it is, good or bad

752
01:54:15,517 --> 01:54:18,449
I should have joined them
and drown in the wells of bitter with them

753
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:22,134
But, I saved the caravan and our future with it

754
01:54:24,116 --> 01:54:26,448
The sing at me?

755
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:29,880
Why sing my father and my brother is not with me?

756
01:54:29,881 --> 01:54:34,101
Do you think I need you to remind me?

757
01:54:35,447 --> 01:54:50,511
Muhammad, Ali, Hamza!
With my nails, Hamza,

758
01:54:50,512 --> 01:55:05,875
I will give you mesher and mesher, with my nails...
killer, cut throater, butcher

759
01:55:05,876 --> 01:55:09,775
murdering beast, you slaughtered my father

760
01:55:09,776 --> 01:55:18,507
Hamza! I will hunt, like a lion

761
01:55:18,508 --> 01:55:29,671
I will make Hamza, my lion, my prey.
And when you are dead Hamza, I will cut your heart out,

762
01:55:29,672 --> 01:55:34,503
taste the blood, cut in pieces

763
01:55:34,504 --> 01:55:39,520
I forbit this weiling.
this cannot go on

764
01:55:40,037 --> 01:55:42,869
What we should do, we will do

765
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:46,802
we will call in our allies,
lead the new one against them

766
01:55:46,803 --> 01:55:51,851
This time, we will prepare it.
We'll plan it

767
01:55:56,534 --> 01:56:01,186
Hamza!

768
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:20,267
come to prayer...
come to prayer...

769
01:56:21,865 --> 01:56:31,521
come to victory...
come to victory...

770
01:56:33,463 --> 01:56:41,616
God is great

771
01:56:42,027 --> 01:56:47,542
There is no god only God

772
01:57:28,754 --> 01:57:31,300
Is it a plague?

773
01:57:31,786 --> 01:57:36,471
what kind of an upside down town have we come in to?

774
01:57:39,219 --> 01:57:43,506
You could fill your pockets very nicely here

775
01:57:44,251 --> 01:57:47,050
No merchant is minding his shop

776
01:57:47,051 --> 01:57:49,973
God is minding the shop

777
01:57:51,451 --> 01:57:53,282
where do you come from?

778
01:57:53,283 --> 01:57:54,829
Yemen

779
01:57:55,416 --> 01:57:57,440
did you stop in Mecca?

780
01:57:58,983 --> 01:58:01,234
It is on the road

781
01:58:01,249 --> 01:58:03,548
you didn't answer my question

782
01:58:03,549 --> 01:58:05,868
did you stop in Mecca?

783
01:58:06,248 --> 01:58:08,245
long enough to rest my camels

784
01:58:08,246 --> 01:58:12,380
Camels rest better in Mecca
than anywhere in the world

785
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:16,112
Yes What is the word on the desert?

786
01:58:16,113 --> 01:58:20,866
Oh... It is bad for you

787
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:27,371
they are gathering..
Each young man with a sword is on his way to Mecca

788
01:58:28,845 --> 01:58:30,743
Our strength is here

789
01:58:30,744 --> 01:58:40,810
Do not underestimate them.
they are summoning up their courage. In Mecca there is music in every house

790
01:59:50,165 --> 01:59:55,351
Abbisinian slave, watch him, he is good, vicious, watch him

791
02:01:14,118 --> 02:01:18,784
I'll free you. give you your weight in silver,

792
02:01:18,785 --> 02:01:24,937
and your height in silk
for one throw like this

793
02:01:43,848 --> 02:01:49,874
So they've come at last
We'll know how many soon enough

794
02:02:07,277 --> 02:02:08,475
It's a big army

795
02:02:08,476 --> 02:02:11,909
3,000 men, hundreds of horses

796
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:13,710
I bet them at Badr

797
02:02:13,711 --> 02:02:15,308
That was a year ago

798
02:02:15,309 --> 02:02:18,857
They've come to revenge Badr

799
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:22,856
Go and get your swords!

800
02:02:49,737 --> 02:02:55,435
Soldiers of Mecca!
Blood master blood

801
02:02:55,436 --> 02:02:59,950
avenge the dead of Badr

802
02:03:04,249 --> 02:03:19,504
BATTLE OF UHUD....

803
02:03:20,304 --> 02:03:28,988
There is Hamza can you see him?

804
02:03:28,989 --> 02:03:31,880
He is your fortune

805
02:03:34,765 --> 02:03:40,426
Ubada! Those horse-men on the flank out there

806
02:03:41,143 --> 02:03:42,577
they are replaced

807
02:03:42,578 --> 02:03:45,582
they are under Khalid.
Khalid...

808
02:03:45,583 --> 02:03:49,168
I often thought of that yound man

809
02:03:49,723 --> 02:03:50,689
Hamza!

810
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:51,592
Yes!

811
02:03:51,593 --> 02:03:55,566
Prophet asks if you have noticed those horse-men

812
02:03:55,567 --> 02:03:58,536
Yes I have. I don't like them

813
02:03:58,537 --> 02:04:00,806
he's sending our 50 archers to watch them

814
02:04:00,807 --> 02:04:06,774
no matter what happens,
the archers must hold off those horse-men

815
02:04:19,137 --> 02:04:23,396
Zaid, tell the Prophet that we are ready

816
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:26,596
What do you think Hamza?

817
02:04:27,517 --> 02:04:31,990
Besides their numbers, I'd say its a fair fight

818
02:04:31,991 --> 02:04:37,217
we see them and they see us

819
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:40,916
what faces me has never frightened me

820
02:04:42,073 --> 02:04:45,068
All praise be Hubar!

821
02:04:57,130 --> 02:05:04,259
When Muhammed gives the word, we'll go to them

822
02:05:33,588 --> 02:05:36,069
Hamza!

823
02:05:38,027 --> 02:05:40,884
Weapons ready

824
02:05:43,972 --> 02:05:47,830
we march now!

825
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:54,432
attack

826
02:07:57,115 --> 02:07:58,249
they've killed Hamza!

827
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:00,264
tackle them

828
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,805
Fight! Fight!

829
02:08:37,011 --> 02:08:38,346
This is a moment of victory

830
02:08:38,347 --> 02:08:41,017
Running away from us. Let's get the loot

831
02:08:41,018 --> 02:08:43,943
Stand where you are told to stand

832
02:08:45,091 --> 02:08:46,259
come back to your positions

833
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,580
all of you, come back!

834
02:08:48,963 --> 02:08:49,998
Its a road

835
02:08:49,999 --> 02:08:51,567
Their centry is gone

836
02:08:51,568 --> 02:08:54,186
We've lost the battle, Khalid

837
02:08:56,008 --> 02:08:58,090
Not yet

838
02:09:53,266 --> 02:09:55,451
hold on

839
02:10:43,746 --> 02:10:44,678
Where is the prophet?

840
02:10:44,679 --> 02:10:45,379
Muhammad is dead

841
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,349
I saw him fall

842
02:10:46,350 --> 02:10:51,441
No No! He's alive! Find him!

843
02:11:12,357 --> 02:11:16,353
back. back to the mountains

844
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:57,948
halt

845
02:12:19,297 --> 02:12:22,701
I thought we were beaten!
Now, victory is yours, Khalid!

846
02:12:22,702 --> 02:12:25,038
We have no victory until
we've finished Muhammad

847
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:26,807
he's up in those rocks

848
02:12:26,808 --> 02:12:31,449
We've finished our business. we've avenged Badr

849
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:33,553
But we can end Islam and him forever!

850
02:12:33,554 --> 02:12:35,321
Some of his fenatics are still with him!

851
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,190
They have the advantage of the mountains

852
02:12:37,191 --> 02:12:39,547
The risk is too high

853
02:12:41,832 --> 02:12:44,347
Muhammad, listen

854
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:54,712
A day for a day! the day of Uhub for the day of Badr

855
02:12:55,288 --> 02:12:59,374
Our dead have answered to your dead

856
02:12:59,694 --> 02:13:07,428
Our dead are in Paradise,
your dead are in hell fire

857
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:48,576
Hamza! Hamza! do you hear me Hamza?
ok You know that I am with you, I, Hind!

858
02:13:49,774 --> 02:13:55,180
do you remember anything Hamza?
How you killed my father and my brother?

859
02:13:55,181 --> 02:14:02,059
now you too are dead!
now, my heart is light

860
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:05,281
do you hear Hamza? Light!

861
02:14:10,974 --> 02:14:18,284
But I haven't finished with you!
Death is too small

862
02:14:18,285 --> 02:14:23,283
Wahshi, Cut him open, cut him!

863
02:14:44,426 --> 02:14:46,997
They lost a battle and what do they do?

864
02:14:46,998 --> 02:14:50,823
They came home and dig the ground harder

865
02:14:52,039 --> 02:14:53,618
They are mad

866
02:14:54,009 --> 02:14:54,507
I agree with you!

867
02:14:54,508 --> 02:15:00,703
They defy reason,
they are even happy they lost

868
02:15:03,024 --> 02:15:06,761
god send the defeat they say
to trial in their faith

869
02:15:06,762 --> 02:15:12,820
Oh yes! they are fighting with the sky!

870
02:15:13,372 --> 02:15:14,572
They'll get what they want!

871
02:15:14,573 --> 02:15:16,276
They want Mecca!

872
02:15:16,277 --> 02:15:17,779
They'll get Mecca

873
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:20,705
when we see the stars at noon....

874
02:15:20,817 --> 02:15:25,314
immm... don't underestimate him, I learned that on my cost

875
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:33,537
my friend, Mecca is more than their home

876
02:15:33,538 --> 02:15:37,545
It's where God spoke to man

877
02:15:37,977 --> 02:15:45,312
Mecca is like a home-sickness to the soul

878
02:15:47,226 --> 02:15:48,894
This year they are going as pilgrims

879
02:15:48,895 --> 02:15:50,764
What?

880
02:15:50,765 --> 02:15:52,500
Unarmed!

881
02:15:52,501 --> 02:15:55,186
Unarmed?

882
02:15:56,373 --> 02:15:59,958
Abu Sufian will slaughter them in the dessert

883
02:16:01,683 --> 02:16:09,279
If you believe in God as they do,
it might be possible not to get slaughtered

884
02:16:11,931 --> 02:16:16,725
But I agree with you, they probably will be

885
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:40,017
Be still, do not let them provoke you.
That is what they want. stand firm

886
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:20,378
Peace be upon you!

887
02:20:43,595 --> 02:20:45,630
Prophet says: All who love God

888
02:20:45,631 --> 02:20:48,201
must renew their Oaths to him

889
02:20:48,202 --> 02:20:50,181
under the tree....

890
02:21:41,153 --> 02:21:43,440
They've sent someone else!

891
02:21:44,291 --> 02:21:49,483
Its Salool.
That means we might come to an agreement

892
02:22:00,417 --> 02:22:07,956
Muhammad, you have been given conditions of truce
between yourself and Mecca

893
02:22:08,262 --> 02:22:11,051
Have you agreed to them yet?

894
02:22:21,516 --> 02:22:23,529
What is this?

895
02:22:23,753 --> 02:22:27,818
In the name of God, the most gracious

896
02:22:28,494 --> 02:22:33,735
Who is this new God they call gracious?

897
02:22:33,736 --> 02:22:37,082
I do not know him. strike him out

898
02:22:37,341 --> 02:22:43,845
And I cannot agree with this...
"Muhammad, the messenger of God?"

899
02:22:44,053 --> 02:22:47,656
If I have thought you were the messenger of God

900
02:22:47,657 --> 02:22:50,947
I would not have fought you

901
02:22:52,665 --> 02:23:01,913
Make it "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah
agrees with Suheil, the son of Amr"

902
02:23:01,914 --> 02:23:04,349
That is the more fact

903
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:06,775
well, so I understand

904
02:23:09,926 --> 02:23:13,197
good, that is better

905
02:23:13,198 --> 02:23:15,690
Now, it is agreed

906
02:23:15,769 --> 02:23:19,474
that you do not continue your pilgrimage,

907
02:23:19,475 --> 02:23:22,144
you must turn around and go home

908
02:23:22,145 --> 02:23:24,763
Mecca is home

909
02:23:26,452 --> 02:23:32,227
However, you may continue your
pilgrimage next year

910
02:23:32,228 --> 02:23:34,163
and for 3 days only

911
02:23:34,164 --> 02:23:41,465
in and out.
we also agree to the truce

912
02:23:41,543 --> 02:23:47,718
for 10 years...
During that time you will not attack any

913
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:52,226
tribe or ambush any caravan

914
02:23:52,227 --> 02:23:58,730
or any individual associated with us and vice versa

915
02:23:59,572 --> 02:24:12,559
If you injure any one of us, the truce ends
and vice versa. Is that clear?

916
02:24:19,937 --> 02:24:24,663
10 years... 10 years of peace....

917
02:24:25,245 --> 02:24:27,795
We need that time

918
02:24:28,251 --> 02:24:31,107
We will use that time

919
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:58,697
These letters, from Muhammad, the messenger of God

920
02:24:58,698 --> 02:25:01,268
to rulers of the world

921
02:25:01,269 --> 02:25:07,510
Call the world to Islam.
to Heraclius, emperor of Byzantium

922
02:25:07,511 --> 02:25:14,619
Kisra, Emperor of Persia,
Mephocus, patriarch of Alexandria

923
02:25:17,194 --> 02:25:19,276
God is great

924
02:25:46,574 --> 02:25:52,417
There are no different races in Islam and

925
02:25:52,418 --> 02:25:54,953
Arab is not superior to foreign

926
02:25:54,954 --> 02:26:03,086
not a  white man superior to a black.
All return equally to god

927
02:26:03,468 --> 02:26:05,135
Unless you desire for your neighbour,

928
02:26:05,136 --> 02:26:09,931
what you desire for yourself.
You don't have faith

929
02:26:10,312 --> 02:26:12,581
A man goes to bed with his belly full,

930
02:26:12,582 --> 02:26:18,013
while his neighbor is hungry.
He isn't a Muslim

931
02:26:18,758 --> 02:26:22,664
The Ink of a scholar is holier than
the blood of a martyr

932
02:26:22,665 --> 02:26:29,107
A man reading is handsome in the side of god

933
02:26:29,108 --> 02:26:35,223
So, learn to read and when you have learned

934
02:26:36,285 --> 02:26:37,537
teach

935
02:26:37,555 --> 02:26:39,057
The people of the book,

936
02:26:39,058 --> 02:26:42,996
Jews with their Bible, the Christians with their testament

937
02:26:42,997 --> 02:26:48,622
must be respected by you for their books likewise came from god

938
02:26:49,773 --> 02:26:53,292
you must all think of Muhammad as more than a man

939
02:26:55,583 --> 02:26:59,823
He was collecting firewood one day.
Let me do it, I said

940
02:26:59,824 --> 02:27:05,597
Why? He said,
You're the prophet of god,

941
02:27:05,598 --> 02:27:11,076
you can't go round scratching for firewood

942
02:27:11,175 --> 02:27:14,670
But he looked at me mumbling

943
02:27:15,348 --> 02:27:18,285
God does not like the man
who considers himself above

944
02:27:18,286 --> 02:27:23,036
other men, he said.
So, I laid back and watched him

945
02:27:23,061 --> 02:27:29,826
Suddenly he stopped.
he stood to his full height and came to me

946
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:32,139
Yes!

947
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:40,182
I am the Prophet of god, he said,
but even I do not know what will become of me

948
02:28:24,424 --> 02:28:27,862
Arm. have you come to take me again?

949
02:28:27,863 --> 02:28:29,786
No

950
02:28:29,898 --> 02:28:32,391
I've come to ask you to take me

951
02:28:51,967 --> 02:29:02,343
I witness that there is only one god
and that Muhammad is His messenger

952
02:29:05,557 --> 02:29:08,983
May god forgive me the times I have fought against you

953
02:29:09,863 --> 02:29:14,952
lslam does the way with all that went before it

954
02:29:18,977 --> 02:29:21,902
I'm sorry, I came here wearing...

955
02:29:24,119 --> 02:29:26,474
Here are my jewels,

956
02:29:27,023 --> 02:29:29,447
what they are worth

957
02:29:29,994 --> 02:29:32,281
I give to the poor

958
02:29:36,238 --> 02:29:37,539
And may I offer you my ?

959
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:39,360
Yes

960
02:29:40,812 --> 02:29:44,340
But you were the bitterest sword against Islam

961
02:29:49,392 --> 02:29:56,624
Now by the will of god,
I will be the raised sword of god

962
02:30:13,663 --> 02:30:17,386
Ah, its all easy to god

963
02:30:17,636 --> 02:30:22,396
Just as he might gain in losing
be may lose in winning

964
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:26,217
2 years agon we thought we were beaten
when we had to sign that truce

965
02:30:26,218 --> 02:30:32,913
Look at us now! charging from victory to victory in the hearts of men

966
02:30:35,832 --> 02:30:37,879
What's that?

967
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:13,245
Abu Sufian is coming

968
02:31:46,377 --> 02:31:49,063
Why am I insulted like this?

969
02:31:50,083 --> 02:31:52,006
Abu Sufian

970
02:31:54,489 --> 02:31:56,708
I expect some courtesy

971
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:58,495
we are not at war

972
02:31:58,496 --> 02:32:00,647
we have a truce

973
02:32:02,536 --> 02:32:05,393
I've come to speak to Muhammad
Where is he?

974
02:32:05,842 --> 02:32:07,730
he is in the mosque

975
02:32:23,602 --> 02:32:27,041
Muhammad we did not break the truce

976
02:32:27,042 --> 02:32:29,644
I have come to re-affirm the truce

977
02:32:29,645 --> 02:32:32,434
I speak for Mecca

978
02:32:33,552 --> 02:32:35,387
Muhammad, why do you turn from me?

979
02:32:35,388 --> 02:32:36,856
Don't go

980
02:32:36,857 --> 02:32:39,927
Muhammad, don't go

981
02:32:39,928 --> 02:32:47,696
Biduns broke the truce, not us.
The night was dark

982
02:32:48,109 --> 02:32:57,483
I am here to testify that the night was dark
Baara! This is your city

983
02:33:01,261 --> 02:33:03,632
Hudaifa, you are my kin
and descendant

984
02:33:03,633 --> 02:33:05,841
why must you be hard?

985
02:33:11,678 --> 02:33:16,419
I am Mecca, I am the leader of Mecca

986
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:19,972
Why am I insulted like this?

987
02:33:20,126 --> 02:33:23,917
Because you keep no promise
and respect no pledge

988
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:28,671
I've heard what I thought
I'd never hear

989
02:33:28,672 --> 02:33:32,190
Abu Sufian asking for pity

990
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:42,927
To be out-fought, out-fought

991
02:33:42,928 --> 02:33:46,065
who we knew to be a one time shepherd

992
02:33:46,066 --> 02:33:49,105
you saw that shepherd's religion grow from a speck (dust)

993
02:33:49,106 --> 02:33:51,040
speck was in my eye

994
02:33:51,041 --> 02:33:55,402
I could see nothing

995
02:33:56,650 --> 02:34:02,048
Tell Mecca that the gods are dead.
It is useless to resist god

996
02:34:02,092 --> 02:34:05,163
Travel fast or every man here

997
02:34:05,164 --> 02:34:06,297
will curse behind you

998
02:34:06,298 --> 02:34:09,884
Its you who have broken the truce

999
02:34:54,108 --> 02:34:58,935
For tonight will be 10,000 men from every tribe

1000
02:35:15,842 --> 02:35:17,745
Now we can fight them. you are back

1001
02:35:17,746 --> 02:35:21,240
we will close the streets, and defend from the houses

1002
02:35:26,091 --> 02:35:28,047
Its no use

1003
02:35:28,696 --> 02:35:31,633
There are thousands of them and they are joined by more

1004
02:35:31,634 --> 02:35:32,902
You coward!

1005
02:35:32,903 --> 02:35:35,471
Hind, go home!

1006
02:35:35,472 --> 02:35:38,911
You coward! Are you the leader of Mecca?

1007
02:35:38,912 --> 02:35:40,447
Look at yourself!

1008
02:35:40,448 --> 02:35:43,918
You are broke, they swallowed you and sput you out

1009
02:35:43,919 --> 02:35:47,858
When my father and brother die, my husband ran away?

1010
02:35:47,859 --> 02:35:49,795
You go home! You!

1011
02:35:49,796 --> 02:35:53,801
We can not resist! Mecca is taken

1012
02:35:53,802 --> 02:35:59,325
No, no!

1013
02:36:04,418 --> 02:36:07,104
We are to camp here for the night

1014
02:36:08,291 --> 02:36:13,222
We can see Mecca even through the mountains!

1015
02:36:23,817 --> 02:36:26,419
So many fires, I can not count them

1016
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:30,041
It is very beautiful

1017
02:36:31,395 --> 02:36:37,453
When we drove them out of Mecca, I did not know
that he carried Mecca with him

1018
02:36:37,939 --> 02:36:39,806
we can smell the bread they are baking

1019
02:36:39,807 --> 02:36:41,041
Yes

1020
02:36:41,042 --> 02:36:46,543
It means they don't intend to plonder,
though I do hope at least thats what it means

1021
02:36:47,153 --> 02:36:50,458
They don't want blood on our walls and doorsteps

1022
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:53,168
I can bargain with that

1023
02:37:34,629 --> 02:37:36,711
Take me to him!

1024
02:37:36,899 --> 02:37:39,049
So you are giving us your city

1025
02:37:44,911 --> 02:37:47,232
you offer me no bread

1026
02:37:52,055 --> 02:37:54,137
I understand

1027
02:37:54,393 --> 02:37:56,578
You may decide to kill me

1028
02:38:30,683 --> 02:38:33,038
Say what you have come to say

1029
02:38:36,993 --> 02:38:42,836
I saw your fires, the men around them

1030
02:38:42,837 --> 02:38:48,611
and I know what power you put into them

1031
02:38:51,082 --> 02:38:54,041
We can no longer resist Muhammad

1032
02:38:55,022 --> 02:38:57,191
Now if you agree

1033
02:38:57,192 --> 02:38:59,946
you dare to come here and ask for conditions

1034
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:04,694
Isn't it yet time enough for you to recognize who Muhammad is?

1035
02:39:06,206 --> 02:39:10,669
Muhammad, there is still doubt in my heart

1036
02:39:10,881 --> 02:39:13,050
If I were to cut off your head, it would remove all your doubts

1037
02:39:13,051 --> 02:39:14,385
Khalid,

1038
02:39:14,386 --> 02:39:16,755
there is no composion in religion

1039
02:39:16,756 --> 02:39:20,861
A man may take many years
or only need minutes

1040
02:39:20,862 --> 02:39:25,224
its god who decides the time!

1041
02:39:25,937 --> 02:39:28,658
So respect his doubts

1042
02:39:33,818 --> 02:39:39,909
You're a black slave, you have the best school

1043
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:45,121
I am only what God has given me

1044
02:39:45,802 --> 02:39:48,386
Yes

1045
02:39:50,209 --> 02:39:52,895
The Gods that I worshipped,

1046
02:39:53,381 --> 02:39:55,634
have never been in use

1047
02:39:57,821 --> 02:39:59,811
It would have helped me

1048
02:40:04,431 --> 02:40:15,983
I require no composion.
There is one God,

1049
02:40:19,355 --> 02:40:24,047
and you are the messenger of god.
Now, let me go.

1050
02:41:39,148 --> 02:41:41,402
get inside

1051
02:44:24,678 --> 02:44:29,217
No doors may be broken down,
nothing plondered, nothing seized

1052
02:44:29,218 --> 02:44:34,024
no one abused, all behind closed doors are safe

1053
02:44:34,025 --> 02:44:37,498
All in hAbu Sufian's house are safe

1054
02:44:37,499 --> 02:44:41,961
All by the side of Kabbalah are safe

1055
02:44:48,714 --> 02:44:53,590
At least, he kept his word,
they haven't forced any door

1056
02:44:53,591 --> 02:44:59,387
He's stolen hearts, not walls.
Its a permanent victory

1057
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:02,523
I dread going out

1058
02:45:03,136 --> 02:45:07,795
we must... we must in the end

1059
02:45:09,515 --> 02:45:11,939
were we so wrong?

1060
02:45:12,888 --> 02:45:20,929
The way we lived, yes. that was wrong
we were trapped in our own faults

1061
02:45:21,233 --> 02:45:23,658
our gods were less than us

1062
02:45:23,939 --> 02:45:29,769
Now there he is, making his entrance to the Kabbaah

1063
02:47:15,648 --> 02:47:21,240
In the name of god, most gracious, most merciful

1064
02:47:22,592 --> 02:47:27,921
God gave this house to Abraham to be a sacred place,

1065
02:47:28,167 --> 02:47:34,168
worship no other God but Him
and cleanse his house

1066
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:54,965
so it was

1067
02:49:54,966 --> 02:50:01,509
Muhammad took no revenge and allowed all.
He declared Mecca a holy place

1068
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:05,315
Noone may shed blood
or cut down a tree,

1069
02:50:05,316 --> 02:50:09,437
or kill a living thing in Mecca

1070
02:50:09,823 --> 02:50:10,656
Soon,

1071
02:50:10,657 --> 02:50:16,532
all Arabia was converted not only to the new worship
but to the new laws, manners,

1072
02:50:16,533 --> 02:50:19,003
attitudes contained in Islam

1073
02:50:19,004 --> 02:50:27,638
The Prophet had lived to see his work done,
and now he began to feel the nearness of death

1074
02:50:28,252 --> 02:50:30,521
One great act of his Prophet would remain

1075
02:50:30,522 --> 02:50:33,126
the setting of its seal

1076
02:50:33,127 --> 02:50:37,233
He called the people to him
and he spoke for the last time

1077
02:50:37,234 --> 02:50:41,672
His message was to surrender to god
and humanity to man

1078
02:50:41,673 --> 02:50:46,413
''Oh, mankind! Listen well!

1079
02:50:46,414 --> 02:50:48,985
I may not be with you much longer

1080
02:50:48,986 --> 02:50:53,425
the weak among you
feed them and watch what you eat

1081
02:50:53,426 --> 02:50:55,762
Dress them as you are dressed,

1082
02:50:55,763 --> 02:51:00,035
you will meet your god
and he will call you

1083
02:51:00,036 --> 02:51:01,437
to count your actions

1084
02:51:01,438 --> 02:51:07,736
Let those who are present warn those who are absent

1085
02:51:08,182 --> 02:51:11,586
You are all are descendant from Adam
and the best among you

1086
02:51:11,587 --> 02:51:16,628
is he who most regards god

1087
02:51:16,629 --> 02:51:23,239
Think deeply about what I say.
Let all your feuds be abolished

1088
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:26,544
you must know that every Muslim

1089
02:51:26,545 --> 02:51:31,117
is the brother of every other Muslim
and all Muslims are brothers of one-another

1090
02:51:31,118 --> 02:51:34,756
Between Muslims, there are no races and no tribes

1091
02:51:34,757 --> 02:51:42,092
Not must you take anything from your brother
except what is given freely

1092
02:51:42,237 --> 02:51:47,065
Do not oppress and do not be oppressed

1093
02:51:48,045 --> 02:51:49,046
O my people!

1094
02:51:49,047 --> 02:51:51,250
I'm but a man,

1095
02:51:51,251 --> 02:51:59,588
It may be that the angel of death will visit me soon
and death will overtake me

1096
02:52:00,163 --> 02:52:01,699
But I have left you a book,

1097
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:03,737
revealed by god,

1098
02:52:03,738 --> 02:52:09,295
The Qur'an, which is light and guidance

1099
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:14,953
Now he repeated to the people
the final repetition of the Qur'an,

1100
02:52:14,954 --> 02:52:16,524
the sea of determination

1101
02:52:16,525 --> 02:52:19,628
not Muhammad's words, but god's word

1102
02:52:19,629 --> 02:52:24,035
''This day I have perfected your religion for you

1103
02:52:24,036 --> 02:52:26,506
and completed my favour to you

1104
02:52:26,507 --> 02:52:31,199
and I have chosen for you Islam as your religion''

1105
02:52:33,184 --> 02:52:35,286
ON June the 8th  632

1106
02:52:35,287 --> 02:52:37,723
in his 63rd year

1107
02:52:37,724 --> 02:52:40,193
Muhammad died

1108
02:52:40,194 --> 02:52:43,732
Many of his followers
could not believe the fact

1109
02:52:43,733 --> 02:52:46,905
How can such a man die?

1110
02:52:46,906 --> 02:52:51,879
But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friend
stood up in the mosque:

1111
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:54,416
"If anyone worships Muhammad,

1112
02:52:54,417 --> 02:52:56,786
Let him know that Muhammad is dead

1113
02:52:56,787 --> 02:52:59,957
but who worships god

1114
02:52:59,958 --> 02:53:05,550
Let him know that god is alive and can not die''

1115
02:53:09,007 --> 02:53:12,811
They buried Muhammad beside his mosque in Medina

1116
02:53:12,812 --> 02:53:17,920
But the religion he preached
found its place in the heart of man

1117
02:53:17,921 --> 02:53:22,976
It endured. It multiplied.

1118
02:53:24,498 --> 02:53:27,467
Still to Mecca, they come, the mankind

1119
02:53:27,468 --> 02:53:31,308
The people of Islam dressed in their pilgrim white

1120
02:53:31,309 --> 02:53:35,202
all equal before god,
all united in this place of prayer

1121
02:53:37,085 --> 02:53:45,676
Each individual soul joined in a community of worship
... "ONE GOD"

1122
