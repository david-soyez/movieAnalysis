When my father started his business,

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,127
Goro was the one who staked him
the money to get it off the ground.

and he manages a local hardware store.

According to DHS,
he is not on any terrorist watch lists,

So, what is he doing in the system?

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,524
Well, after 9/11, he tried to enlist
in the Marines, but he psyched out.

Maybe he is still   off about it.

See, the thing is,
that happened 14 years ago.

until now to do something about it?

They sent in a SEAL team.

but Hadad got away.

to neutralize the threat,

from off of their throats and now

CHIN HO: I just got off the phone
with Los Alamos National Lab.

389
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,451
The W80 warhead that we are looking for
is a Model 1

390

with a dial-a-yield setting
of between 5 and 150 kilotons.

Okay, which means what, exactly?

392
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,530
It means that if Bennett turns it up
to its maximum yield,

393
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,768
the blast radius will be 2.9 miles.

394
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,730
Everything within the first mile
will be completely destroyed.

395
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,926
Also, according to Los Alamos,

396
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,244
the center of Waikiki is the prime location
for mass casualties.
