647
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,570
And that is when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

648
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,561
Pym Tech.

649
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,806
Yes.

650
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,560
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

651
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,880
Darren Cross.

652
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,007
he is a big deal.

653
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,560
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

654
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,964
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

655
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,361
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

656
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,001
he began to suspect
that I was not telling him everything.

657
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,761
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

658
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,049
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

659
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,607
But I would not help him.

660
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,526
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

661
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,125
How could he do that?

662
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,010
The boarthes chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

663
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,411
She was the deciding vote.

664
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,005
But she came back to me

665
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,448
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

666
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,761
The process is highly volatile.

667
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,684
If one is not protected
by a specialized helmet,

668
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,650
it can affect the braings chemistry.

669
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,681
I do not think Darren realizes this,

670
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,604
and, you know, he is not
the most stable guy to begin with.

671
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,442
So, what do you want from me?

672
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,206
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

673
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,281
Do you?

674
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,805
I do.

675
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,970
If you can help me,

676
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,761
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

677
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,167
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

678
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,841
Absolutely.

679
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,686
My days of breaking into places
and stealing   are done.

680
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,125
What do you want me to do?

681
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,602
I want you to break into a place
and steal some  .

682
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,080
Are you going to be home
for dinner tonight?

683
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,321
a, yeah. I will pick something up.
Text me.

684
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,686
Okay. Good news?

685
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,202
a... I do not know. it is news.

686
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,806
Are you trying to find my daddy?

687
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,449
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

688
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,165
I just want your daddy to be safe.

689
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,368
Hope you do not catch him.

690
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,170
This is not the first time these guys

691
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,050
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

692
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,170
that is Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

693
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,607
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

694
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,049
He always wanted my tech.

695
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,442
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

696
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,648
and destroy all the dato,

697
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,690
Darren Cross is going to unleash chaos
upon the world.

698
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,165
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

699
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,244
I spent half my life

700
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,483
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

701
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,326
I am sure as   not going to
hand-deliver it to one now.

702
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,802
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

703
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,406
This could change the texture of reality.

704
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,410
Besides, they are probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

705
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,963
Okay, then why do not you
just send the ants?

706
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,768
Scott, they are ants.

707
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,765
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

708
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,687
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that is designed to prevent infiltration.

709
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,367
Hank, I am a thief, all right? I mean,
I am a good thief, but this is insane.

710
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,522
he is right, Hank.
And you know it.

711
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,206
you have seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

712
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,330
I was against using him
when we had months,

713
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,368
and now we have days.

714
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,441
I am wearing the suit.

715
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,931
Absolutely not!

716
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,924
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

717
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,570
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

718
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,325
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission can not work.

719
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,846
- We do not have time to   around!
- Hope, please listen to me...

720
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,490
He is a criminal!
I am your daughter.

721
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,891
No!

722
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,044
She is right, Hank.

723
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,804
I am not your guy.

724
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,721
Why do not you wear the suit?

725
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,007
You think I do not want to?

726
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,320
I cannot.

727
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,803
I spent years wearing it,

728
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,647
and it took a toll on me.

729
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,371
you are our only option.

730
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,684
Before Hope lost her mother,

731
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,685
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

732
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,848
And now she looks at me
and there is just disappointment.

733
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,162
it is too late for me,

734
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,129
but not for you.

735
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,163
This is your chance.

736
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,847
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

737
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,811
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

738
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,046
it is not about saving our world.

739
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,730
it is about saving theirs.

740
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,523
 . That was a good speech.

741
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,201
Scott,

742
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,040
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

743
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,486
In the right hands,

744
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,848
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

745
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,686
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

746
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,604
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

747
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,886
you need to be fast.

748
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,883
You should be able to shrink and grow

749
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,166
on a dime.

750
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,082
So your size always suits your needs.

751
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,009
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

752
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,051
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

753
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,445
Ow!

754
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,761
Ahhh!

755
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,770
Ow!

756
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,086
Useless.

757
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,845
When you are small,
energy's compressed,

758
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,843
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

759
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,208
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
you are like a bullet.

760
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,648
You punch too hard, you   someone.
Too soft, it is a love tap.

761
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,165
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

762
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,044
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

763
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,849
Show me.

764
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,680
- Terrible.
- You want to show me how to punch?

765
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,281
Show me...

766
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,484
that is how you punch.

767
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,325
- She is been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

768
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,051
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

769
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,240
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

770
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,328
We lost her in a plane crash.

771
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,129
it is bad enough
you will not tell me how she died.

772
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,770
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

773
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,604
we are working, here.

774
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,520
All right, princess.
let us get back to work.

775
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,521
Were you going for the hand?

776
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,968
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

777
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,725
Do not   with the regulator.

778
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,564
If that regulator is compromised,

779
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,210
you would go subatomic.

780
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,645
What does that mean?

781
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,882
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,411
What does that mean?

783
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,008
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

784
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,127
become irrelevant

785
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,044
as you shrink for all eternity.

786
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,371
Everything that you know

787
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,771
and love,

788
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,250
gone forever.

789
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,482
Cool. Yeah, if it am not broke...

790
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,891
you have learned about the suit,

791
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,691
but you have yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

792
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,047
the ants.

793
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,926
Loyal, brave,

794
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,809
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

795
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,764
Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

796
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,047
<i>they are lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

797
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,566
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

798
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,324
you are not so crazy.

799
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,722
Hey!

800
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,126
you are cute.

801
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,728
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

802
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,766
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

803
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,763
<i>there is a security guard posted
around the clock.</i>

804
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,446
we will need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

805
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,091
Okay, who is next?

806
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,451
Paraponera clavato.

807
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,170
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

808
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,810
Number 1 on the  pain index?

809
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,729
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

810
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,480
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

811
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,851
And the only access point is a tube

812
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,685
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

813
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,603
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

814
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,887
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

815
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,724
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

816
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,406
you are going to need to signal
the crazy ants to   the servers,

817
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,565
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

818
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,802
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

819
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,080
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

820
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,930
Ideal for ground and air transport.

821
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,684
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

822
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,281
I am going to call him "Ant-thony."

823
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,600
that is good. that is very good.

824
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,322
Because this time, you are really going to
have to learn how to control him.

825
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,131
<i>Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.</i>

826
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,366
Aw! You okay?
Did I hurt...

827
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,248
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

828
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,600
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

829
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,040
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

830
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,650
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

831
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,166
Solenopsis mandibularis.

832
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,571
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

833
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,371
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

834
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,523
<i>They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.</i>

835
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,844
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

836
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,562
they are not listening to me.

837
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,291
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

838
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,328
No shortcuts, no lies.

839
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,088
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

840
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,685
We do not have time for coddling.

841
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,922
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

842
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,411
Really?

843
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,164
Is that where our focus should be?

844
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,646
Hope!

845
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,171
I do not know why I came to you
in the first place.

846
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,287
We cannot do this without her.

847
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,521
Oh,  .

848
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,568
You have got to lock your doors.

849
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,530
I mean, really, there is some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

850
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,284
Do you think this is a joke?

851
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,846
Do you have any idea what
he is asking you to risk?

852
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,160
You have a daughter.

853
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,571
I am doing this for her.

854
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,610
You know, when my mother died,
I did not see him for two weeks.

855
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
He was in grief.

856
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,805
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

857
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,486
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

858
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,283
He just sent me off to boarding school.

859
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,601
You know, I thought,

860
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,805
with all that is at stake,

861
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,043
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

862
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,043
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

863
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,010
He does not want to shut you out.
He trusts you.

864
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,445
Then why are you here?

865
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,522
It proves that he loves you.

866
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,207
Hope. Look at me.

867
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,130
I am expendable.

868
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,205
that is why I am here.

869
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,203
You must have realized that by now.

870
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,287
I mean, it is why I am in the suit
and you are not.

871
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,527
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

872
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,487
Anyway...

873
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,963
You know,
I did not know you had a daughter

874
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,281
when I called the cops on you.

875
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,481
what is her name?

876
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,810
Cassie.

877
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,324
it is a pretty name.

878
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,564
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

879
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,608
that is how it works.

880
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,171
Think about Cassie.

881
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,165
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

882
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,689
Open your eyes

883
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,127
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

884
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,200
that is good!

885
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,970
Your mother convinced me

886
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,123
to let her join me on my missions.

887
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,802
They called her the Wasp.

888
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,121
She was born to it.

889
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,728
And there is not a day that goes by

890
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,604
that I do not regret having said yes.

891
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,764
It was 1987.

892
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,043
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

893
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,570
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

894
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,169
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

895
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,163
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

896
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,162
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

897
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,483
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

898
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,645
<i>Your mother,</i>

899
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,085
<i>she did not hesitate.</i>

900
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,844
Janet! No!

901
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,080
She turned off her regulator

902
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,569
and went subatomic

903
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,168
to deactivate the bomb.

904
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,769
And she was gone.

905
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,328
Your mom died a hero.

906
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,321
And I spent the next 10 years

907
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,764
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

908
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,448
You were trying to bring her back.

909
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,687
But all I learned was we know nothing.

910
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,523
it is not your fault.

911
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,364
She made her choice.

912
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,526
But why did not you tell me that sooner?

913
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,570
I was trying to protect you.

914
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,050
I lost your mother.

915
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,925
I did not mean to lose you, too.

916
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,125
I am sorry.

917
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,766
This is awesome.

918
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,524
it is awesome, you know?

919
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,682
You guys are breaking down walls,
you are healing.

920
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,205
it is important.

921
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,610
I ruined the moment, did not I?

922
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,409
Yes, you did. Yes.

923
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,483
I am going to make some tea.

924
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,201
Nailed it!

925
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,488
that is a good boy, Ant-thony.

926
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,243
<i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

927
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,481
it is freezing!

928
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,927
You could not make a suit
with a flannel lining?

929
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,491
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

930
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,291
it is a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

931
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,044
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

932
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,009
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

933
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,010
it is currently collecting dust

934
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,209
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

935
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,248
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

936
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,203
you are over the target area.

937
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,607
Disengage now, Scott!

938
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,841
Squadron A, go!

939
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,251
B, go!

940
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,761
C, go!

941
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,251
All right, Ant-thony,
please do not drop me this time.

942
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,402
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

943
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,527
Stay calm.

944
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,249
Guys?
We might have a problem.

945
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,767
Hank, did not you say
this was some old warehouse?

946
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,887
it is not!

947
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,163
<i>You son of a  !</i>

948
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,369
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

949
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,521
<i>Abort now!</i>

950
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,331
No, it is okay.
It does not look like anyone's home.

951
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,488
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

952
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,441
he is going to lose the suit.

953
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,010
he is going to lose his life.

954
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,968
<i>All right, I am on the roof
of the target building.</i>

955
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,690
Somebody's home, Scott.

956
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,171
<i>what is going on down there, Sam?</i>

957
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,366
it is the Falcon!

958
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,168
I had a sensor trip
but I am not seeing anything.

959
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,721
Wait a second.

960
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,808
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

961
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,405
it is okay. He cannot see me.

962
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,527
I can see you.

963
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,761
He can see me.

964
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,043
Hi. I am Scott.

965
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,770
Did he just say, "Hi, I am Scott"?

966
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,128
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I am a big fan.

967
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,850
Appreciate it. So, who the   are you?

968
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,841
I am Ant-Man.

969
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,160
"Ant-Man"?

970
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,362
What? You have not heard of me?

971
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,204
No, you would not have heard of me.

972
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,045
You want to tell me what you want?

973
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,561
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

974
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,369
Just for a few days. I am going to return it.

975
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,091
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

976
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,571
I know exactly how that is.

977
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,527
Located the breach.

978
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,080
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

979
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,085
What the   are you doing?

980
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,760
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

981
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,126
Sorry!

982
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,730
Look, I am sorry about this. Sorry.

983
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,481
that is enough!

984
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,204
Ant-thony! A little help!

985
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,966
I have lost visual.

986
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,480
he is inside my pack!

987
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,607
Sorry!

988
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,520
You seem like a really great guy.

989
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,360
it is really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

990
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,167
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

991
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,081
You jeopardized everything!

992
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,644
You got it.

993
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,641
Well done.

994
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
Wait a minute.

995
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,171
Did you just compliment me?

996
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,720
- He did, did not he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

997
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,046
I was good, was not I?

998
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,241
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and did not die?

999
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,800
Let us not dwell on the past.

1000
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,008
We have got to finish our planning.

1001
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,044
do not mind him.

1002
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,561
You did good.

1003
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,726
Darren.

1004
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,370
How the   did you get in here?

1005
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,841
You left the front door open, Hank.

1006
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,240
it is official.

1007
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,441
you are old.

1008
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,161
The plans.

1009
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,164
He will   him.

1010
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,085
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1011
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,610
I have good news.

1012
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,920
Really?

1013
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,761
what is that?

1014
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,002
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1015
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,880
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1016
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,726
we are anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1017
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,446
you are welcome.

1018
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,280
I know this is odd,
but I would like you to be there.

1019
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,962
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1020
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,770
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1021
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,126
I will be there.

1022
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,645
What did you see in me?

1023
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,251
I do not know what you mean.

1024
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,766
All those years ago, you picked me.

1025
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,330
What did you see?

1026
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,284
I saw myself.

1027
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,281
Then why did you push me away?

1028
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,162
Because I saw too much of myself.

1029
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,451
<i>He knows. he is baiting you.</i>

1030
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,249
We have to call it off.

1031
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,481
we are all taking risks.

1032
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,891
What if he saw me here?

1033
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,291
He did not. there is no way.

1034
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,727
How do you know that?

1035
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,486
Darren, hi.

1036
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,410
Hope, where are you right now?

1037
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,246
I am at home. Why?

1038
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,084
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

1039
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,969
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

1040
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,601
do not let him rile you up.
he is just a senile old man.

1041
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,126
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

1042
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,049
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

1043
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,406
<i>And I am tripling security.</i>

1044
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,482
Full sensors at all entrances

1045
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,962
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1046
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,684
Great. Good idea.

1047
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,084
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I am so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

1048
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,003
he is tripling security.
he is lost his mind, and he is onto you.

1049
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,048
But he is not onto you.

1050
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,487
he is adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1051
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,329
and closing exterior vents.

1052
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,323
How are we going to get Scott inside?

1053
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,365
The water main.

1054
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,403
You cannot add security to a water main.

1055
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,801
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1056
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,086
that is how I get in.

1057
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,367
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1058
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,805
to change the water pressure.

1059
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,611
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1060
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,205
So we expand our team.

1061
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,801
What do we need?

1062
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,282
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1063
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,203
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1064
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,691
and   the laser grid,

1065
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,081
and a getaway guy.

1066
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,131
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

1067
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,205
Thank you for the coffee, madam.

1068
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,887
it is not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1069
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,849
Because we just robbed you.

1070
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,961
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1071
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,326
Two smoothie machines.

1072
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,010
Are you sure they can handle this?

1073
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,491
Oh, we can handle it.
we are professionals.

1074
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,167
you will forgive us if we are not
instilled with confidence.

1075
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,931
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1076
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,331
We know our business.

1077
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,767
We broke into this spooky-  house,
did not we?

1078
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,285
I let you.

1079
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,648
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1080
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,042
- Look, it is okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

1081
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,884
- You got their credentials?
- he is in the system.

1082
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,440
- I am in the system?
- you are in the system.

1083
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,726
The system?

1084
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,087
Yeah, we are doomed.

1085
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,207
All right.

1086
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,964
there is something
you guys need to see.

1087
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,883
When you get to this corner,

1088
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,725
there is going to be three offices
on your left side.

1089
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,131
 !

1090
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,531
Whoa! that is so cool, bro!

1091
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,285
Now, look,
this is going to get weird, all right?

1092
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,603
it is pretty freaky, but it is safe.
there is no reason to be scared.

1093
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,011
Oh, no, no. Daddy do not get scared.

1094
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

1095
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,161
Good.

1096
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,243
This is the work of gypsies.

1097
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,446
that is witchcraft.

1098
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,681
Wow, that is amazing.

1099
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,810
that is like some David Copperfield  .

1100
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,961
that is some kind of wizardry.

1101
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,121
This is sorcery!

1102
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,326
how did you do that, bro?

1103
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,368
do not freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1104
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,166
Ahhh!

1105
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,685
Get off! Get off!

1106
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,286
Wait, I thought
Daddy did not get scared!

1107
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,971
I gave them each half a Xanax

1108
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,646
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1109
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,882
They fell right asleep.

1110
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,131
Hey, look, I want to thank you for...

1111
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,163
No, please do not.

1112
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,686
we are all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1113
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,606
I am just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1114
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,763
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1115
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,525
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1116
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,204
to almost liking you.

1117
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,009
You really should write poetry.

1118
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,089
Get some sleep, Scott.

1119
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,410
All right, just so we are clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1120
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,084
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1121
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,491
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1122
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,005
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1123
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,600
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

1124
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,244
- that is what is up.
- Luis.

1125
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,527
I am sorry. I am good. I am good.
I am just excited.

1126
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,931
Plus, your girlfrienthes really hot.

1127
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,331
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1128
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,401
And you are very beautiful, madam.

1129
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,369
- Oh, my Lord.
- She is not my...

1130
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,727
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1131
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,723
Like a whistling. You know
what I am saying? To like, blend in.

1132
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,883
No. do not whistle. No whistling.

1133
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,008
it is not <i>The Andy Griffith</i> Show.
No whistling.

1134
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,046
All clear in Sector One.

1135
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,361
Step out.

1136
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,166
All clear.

1137
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,966
we are set.

1138
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,885
Wish me luck.

1139
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,004
Utilities online.

1140
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,249
Hey! What are you doing?

1141
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,408
a... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I am securing it.

1142
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,131
I am the boss.

1143
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,890
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

1144
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,122
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

1145
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,483
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

1146
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,971
All right, I see it.

1147
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,442
All right, come on, I have got to get up there.
that is it. that is it, guys! Yes!

1148
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,689
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1149
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,481
All right, let us fly, Ant-thony.

1150
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,962
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1151
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,964
Pymys pulling up. Right on time.

1152
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,048
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1153
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,326
This is problem?

1154
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,448
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

1155
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,681
for undercover cops, man,

1156
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,851
yes, this is problem.

1157
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,841
that is Pym.

1158
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,925
Oh, no.

1159
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,240
I am deploying the bullet ants.

1160
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,885
<i>Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...</i>

1161
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,884
<i>I do not remember what it is called,
but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

1162
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,326
- what is up, man?
- Hey.

1163
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,605
Ow! Ow!

1164
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,486
See? that is what I am talking about.

1165
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,961
that is what I call
an unfortunate casualty

1166
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,042
in a very serious operation.

1167
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,408
Signal decoy in place.

1168
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,883
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1169
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,407
Looks like Pymys getting arrested.

1170
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,164
Scott, we have problem.

1171
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,163
<i>Problem? what is the problem?</i>

1172
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,480
Dave! Dave, that is not part of plan!

1173
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,210
Listen to me.

1174
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,080
If I do not get into this building,
people will die.

1175
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,449
that is awfully dramatic.

1176
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,606
Are you kidding me?

1177
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,844
Problem solved.

1178
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,966
Well...

1179
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,603
How do I look?

1180
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,881
There he is.

1181
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,683
Just in time. Come on.

1182
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,889
<i>12-point verification.</i>

1183
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,769
Little over-the-top,
do not you think, Darren?

1184
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,365
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

1185
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,044
Well, you can never be too safe.

1186
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,640
<i>Access granted.</i>

1187
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,330
have got to hand it to you, Darren.

1188
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,968
You really did it.

1189
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,883
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1190
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,730
Arriving in second position.

1191
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,688
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. let us go!

1192
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,966
Proceeding to command position.

1193
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,364
I will be right back, Ant-thony.

1194
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,362
All right, guys. I am in position.

1195
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,124
I am going to signal the ants.

1196
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,487
No, no, no, no, no!

1197
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,926
Did you see that?

1198
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,970
Assume formation.

1199
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,963
All right, you cute little crazies,

1200
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,769
let us fry these servers!

1201
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,082
let us go get them, buddy!

1202
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,601
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

1203
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,887
Dato backup completely erased.

1204
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,564
Heading to the particle chamber.

1205
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,923
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1206
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,281
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1207
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,521
Wonderful.

1208
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,444
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1209
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,124
they are representatives of Hydra.

1210
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,531
they are not what they were.

1211
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,887
they are doing some interesting work.

1212
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,406
And I am enjoying myself.

1213
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,322
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1214
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,368
And now it is going to   up in your face.

1215
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,327
Wow.

1216
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,721
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

1217
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,882
but I just figured it would
be all pathetic and weak.

1218
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,485
Well, you figured wrong.

1219
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,011
I know this van.

1220
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,601
Anybody home?

1221
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,441
All right, guys. I am here.

1222
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,849
I am setting the charges.

1223
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,729
Great job, guys.
I will take it from here.

1224
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,446
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1225
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,401
Final position.

1226
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,327
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1227
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,970
- Almost.
- No, you are not.

1228
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,520
- I am getting close!
- No, you are not.

1229
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,804
San Francisco P.D.!

1230
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,881
Out of the van!

1231
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,520
I know you are in there!

1232
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,722
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

1233
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,522
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

1234
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,601
So close.

1235
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,811
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1236
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,530
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1237
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,523
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1238
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,090
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I am coming.

1239
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,969
Take it easy!

1240
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,008
No, I will not move! Go now!

1241
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,208
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1242
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,121
Phew!

1243
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,761
What? What?

1244
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,686
Hey, little guy.

1245
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,529
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1246
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Which begs the question,

1247
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,802
who is the new Ant-Man?

1248
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,326
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1249
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,289
trusted even more than me?

1250
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,807
Scott Lang.

1251
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,610
A martyr

1252
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,166
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1253
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,847
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.
