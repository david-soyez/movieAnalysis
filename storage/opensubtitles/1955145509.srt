00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:41,710
Chapter One Last Stage to Red Rock.

3
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,800
Got room for one more?

4
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Who the hell are you, and what happened to them?

5
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,900
Names Major Marquis Warren former U.S. Cavalry.

6
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,970
Currentrly I'm a servant of the court.

7
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,010
Trying to bringing a coupla' no-goods into market.

8
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,200
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket.

9
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,110
You taking them into Red Rock?

10
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,380
I figure that's where you headed, right?

11
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,230
That damblasted blizzards been on our ass for the last three hours.

12
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,530
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the way to Red Rock 'fore it catches us.

13
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,460
So ya' hightailing it halfway to Minnie's Haberdashery?

14
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,400
You know I am.

15
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,300
- May I come aboard?
- Well smoke...

16
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,370
it up to me, yes.

17
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,560
- But it ain't up to me.
- Who's it up to?

18
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,760
Fella in the wagon.

19
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,300
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company?

20
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,840
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private trip.

21
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,270
And I'm here to tell ya'...

22
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,580
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.

23
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,510
So if you wanna' go to Minnie's with us...

24
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,210
- you gotta' talk to him.
- Well...

25
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,930
that's what I'll do.

26
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,230
Hold it black fella'!

27
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,200
'Fore you approach,

28
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,600
you take them two guns of yours and lay them on that rock over yonder.

29
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,570
Then you raise both your hands way above your hat.

30
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,220
Then you approach...

31
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,280
molasses-like.

32
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,550
Real trusting fella', huh?

33
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,920
Not so much.

34
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,800
Put them down.

35
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,950
Come on ahead.

36
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,810
I said way above your hat, god dammit.

37
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Now come forward.

38
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,050
That's far enough.

39
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,860
I'll be dogged, you black fella' I know.

40
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,830
Col. Something Warren, right?

41
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,290
Major Marquis Warren.

42
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,920
I know you too.

43
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,070
We shared a steak dinner once upon a time in Chattanooga.

44
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,510
You John Ruth, The Hangman.

45
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,820
That be me.

46
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,730
- How longs that been?
- Since that steak?

47
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,670
Eight months.

48
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,650
So why don't you explain to me...

49
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,550
what an african bounty hunter's doing wandering

50
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,170
around in the snow in the middle of Wyoming.

51
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,330
I'm trying to get a coupla' of bounty's to Red Rock.

52
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,390
So you still in business?

53
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,050
You know I am.

54
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,150
What happened to your horse?

55
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,660
Circumstances caused us to take the long way around. My horse couldn't make it.

56
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,420
You don't know nothing about this fella here?

57
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,690
Nope.

58
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,450
Don't even know your name?

59
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,570
Nope.

60
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,110
Well I guess that makes this one fortuitous wagon.

61
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,080
I sure as hell hope so.

62
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,240
Major Marquis Warren, this here is Daisy Domergue.

63
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,610
Domergue, to you, this is Major. Warren.

64
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,880
Howdy nigger!

65
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,930
She's a pepper, ain't she?

66
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,790
Now girl, don't you know darkee's don't like being

67
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,980
called niggers no more. They find it offensive.

68
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,830
- I been called worse.
- Now that I can believe.

69
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,430
- Heard of her?
- Should I?

70
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,950
Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth, but...

71
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,160
maybe you might of heard tell 'bout the price on her head.

72
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,350
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

73
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,310
Damn, what she do? Kill Lily Langtree?

74
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,450
Not quite.

75
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,640
Now that ten thousand's practically in my pocket.

76
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,480
It's why I ain't too anxious to be handing out rides.

77
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,080
Especially to professionals open for business.

78
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,120
Well I certainly can appreciate that. I ain't got no designs on her.

79
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,510
One of my fella's over there is worth four

80
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,180
thousand, one's worth three, and one's worth one.

81
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,460
That's damn sure good enough for me.

82
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
Well...

83
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,710
Let me see their paperwork.

84
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,940
Like I said, molasses-like.

85
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Back off.

86
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,940
Look...

87
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,380
I sure hate to interrupt y'all! But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,

88
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,780
hot on our asses we trying to beat to shelter!

89
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,320
I realize that!

90
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,530
Now shut your mouth and hold them damn horses while I think!

91
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,790
Okay boy, we'll give it a try.

92
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,310
But you leave those pistols over yonder with the driver.

93
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,850
You ain't really gonna' let that nigger riding in

94
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,310
here is ya'? I mean maybe up there with O.B., but...

95
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,530
How you like the sound of them bells, bitch?

96
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,560
They are real pretty, ain't they?

97
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,170
You open up your trashy mouth again, I'll knock

98
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,040
out them front teeth for ya'. You got it?

99
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah.

100
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,650
Let me hear you say: "I got it."

101
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,900
I got it.

102
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,910
Well, I'm gonna need some help tying these fella's up on the roof.

103
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,710
Give O.B. fifty dollars when ya' get to Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.

104
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, I agree with O.B. This storm's got me concerned.

105
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,520
We get going a lot quicker you help out too.

106
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,040
Goddammit to hell, I'm already regretting this!

107
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,850
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.

108
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,340
And my wrist is gonna' stay cuffed to hers, and

109
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,630
she ain't never gonna' leave my goddamn side,

110
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,480
until I personally put her in the Red Rock jail! Now do you got that?

111
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,890
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

112
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,170
So what happend to your horse?

113
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,800
He got old.

114
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,680
I done had him for a bit.

115
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,000
When the weather took a turn for the worse, he

116
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,380
done what he could, but he couldn't make it.

117
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,260
- That's too bad.
- Yes it is.

118
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,330
Me an' ole Lash rode a lotta' miles together.

119
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,350
You could say he was my best friend... if I

120
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,790
considered stupid animals firends, which I don't.

121
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,640
Never the less... I'm gonna' miss them.

122
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,110
Who's Daisy Domergue?

123
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,900
A no damn good murdering bitch, that's who.

124
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,040
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope.

125
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,310
- If by woman, you mean her?

126
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,740
No I do not have mixed emotions.

127
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,870
So you taking her into Red Rock to hang?

128
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,680
- You bet.
- Gonna' wait to watch it?

129
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,510
You know I am.

130
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,900
I wanna' hear her neck snap with my own two ears.

131
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,820
You never wait to watch them hang?

132
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,040
My bounties never hang,

133
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,080
cause I never bring them in alive.

134
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,540
Never?

135
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Never ever.

136
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,870
We talked about this in Chattanooga.

137
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,120
Bringing desperate men in alive, is a good way to get yourself dead.

138
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,460
Can't catch me sleeping if I don't close my eyes.

139
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,880
I don't wanna' work that hard.

140
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,830
No one said the job was suppose to be easy.

141
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,400
No one said it was suppose to be that hard, nether.

142
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,800
But that little lady,

143
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,270
is why they call him "The Hangman".

144
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,000
When the handbill says Dead or Alive, the rest of

145
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,690
us shoot ya' in the back from up on top of a perch

146
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,900
somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.

147
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,320
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya',

148
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,810
you don't die by a bullet in the back.

149
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,180
When The Hangman catches you... you hang.

150
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,260
You overrate them nigger.

151
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,670
I'll give you he got guts.

152
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,980
But in the brains department,

153
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,540
he like a man who took a high dive in a low well.

154
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,020
Now Daisy,

155
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,690
I want us to work out a signal system of communication.

156
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,710
When I elbow you real hard in the face...

157
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,680
that means: Shut up.

158
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,870
You got it?

159
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,690
I got it.

160
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,360
I...

161
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,840
I know we only met each other once before.

162
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,860
And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy. But...

163
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
Well...

164
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,190
You still got it?

165
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,140
I still got, what?

166
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,950
The Lincoln letter?

167
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,330
Of course.

168
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,250
Do you got it on you?

169
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,090
Where?

170
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,250
Right here.

171
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,500
Look, I know you gotta' be real careful with it and all.

172
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,660
I can imagine you probably don't like to take

173
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,660
it in an'out of the envelope all that often.

174
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,310
But if you wouldn't mind,

175
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,280
I'd sure appreciate seeing that again.

176
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
You right,

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,850
I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much.

178
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,560
- Yeah.
- But...

179
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,500
as your saving my life an' all,

180
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,680
I suppose I could let you read it again.

181
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,290
"Ole Mary Todd's calling, so I guess it must be time for bed."

182
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,390
Ole Mary Todd.

183
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
That gets me.

184
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,570
That gets me too.

185
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,540
You know what this is, tramp?

186
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,510
It's a letter from Lincoln.

187
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,300
It's a letter from Lincoln to him.

188
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,630
They shared a correspondence during the war.

189
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,500
They was pen pals. This is just one of the letters.

190
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,390
What the...

191
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
O.B.

192
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,160
Stop!

193
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,230
Whoa, easy.

194
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,930
Of all the stupid,

195
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,600
like to rip my goddamn arm off!

196
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,380
I didn't,

197
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,130
drag her stiking ass up this goddamn mountain, just

198
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,730
for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town.

199
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,580
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.

200
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,540
I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you!

201
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,420
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

202
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,610
You ruin that letter of his,

203
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,710
that niggers gonna' stomp your ass to death. And when he do,

204
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,910
I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh.

205
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
How is it?

206
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,990
She didn't help it none.

207
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,290
But it's alright.

208
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,170
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?

209
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,450
You... ain't no goddamn... lady!

210
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,850
Hey Mister Ruth?

211
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
What?

212
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!

213
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,650
What?

214
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,160
I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!

215
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,370
Considering there's a blizzard going on,

216
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,630
whole lotta' fellas walking around, wouldn't you say, Major?

217
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,610
Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah...

218
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,300
seems to be a lot of them.

219
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,080
This changes things, son.

220
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,730
Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger.

221
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,940
But with a partner, eighteen's a whole lot better.

222
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,070
You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'? Or her?

223
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,540
- Put them on.
- I ain't wearing handcuffs.

224
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,430
You put those on or you can stop worrying about this whole thing, right now.

225
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,590
Chapter Two Son of a Gun.

226
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,530
Hand your weapons to the driver.

227
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,130
Little jumpy, ain't you?

228
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,440
Never mind the jokes, just do it.

229
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,520
- If you say so.
- I do.

230
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Okay...

231
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,890
I done did it.

232
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,780
O.B.? Ya' got them?

233
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,040
- I got them!
- Okay fella',

234
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,570
you keep holding that lantern in that one hand,

235
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,760
and you keep that other hand where I can see it.

236
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,100
Walk over there where I can get a good look at cha'.

237
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,350
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.

238
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,440
Is that you Chris Mannix?

239
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,370
- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.

240
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,940
- You know this fella'?
- Only by reputation.

241
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,990
Like I said friend,

242
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,310
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.

243
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,730
Keeping you at a disadvantage, is a advantage I intend to keep.

244
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,710
Whoever you are mister,

245
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,840
you sure sound tough when you're talking

246
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,250
to a desperate man knee deep in snow.

247
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,780
I don't want no trouble.

248
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,010
I just wanna' ride. I'm freezin to death.

249
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,910
Who is this joker.

250
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,980
You heard of the rebel renegade Erskine Mannix?

251
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,800
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

252
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,210
The scourge of South Carolina, Mannix Marauders.

253
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,600
That's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

254
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,970
What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?

255
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,820
Well Mr. Face,

256
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,080
I was riding to Red Rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,

257
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,390
fucked up his leg, an' had to put 'er down.

258
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,910
You got business in Red Rock?

259
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,720
- Yes I do.
- What?

260
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,690
I'm the new sheriff.

261
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,800
- Horseshit.
- 'Fraid not.

262
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,740
- Where is your star?
- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.

263
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,280
Once I get there they swear me in, but that ain't happened yet.

264
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,060
And that's when you get your star.

265
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,290
You got anything that can back any of this up?

266
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,550
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

267
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,870
And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there,

268
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,480
I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business.

269
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,890
And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?

270
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,860
Three dead.

271
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,860
One alive.

272
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,540
- Who's that?
- Daisy Domergue.

273
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,800
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

274
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,750
Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except me and the hangman.

275
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,950
The Hangman?

276
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,080
Well I'll be double dogged damned.

277
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,810
- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.
- It's John.

278
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,170
And you...

279
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,680
your're the nigger with the head...

280
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,580
Major Marquis.

281
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,390
My lord, is that really the real head of Major Marquis, looking at me now?

282
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,020
Yeah it's really me and it's really my head.

283
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,830
What's going on, y'all having a bounty hunters picnic?

284
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,990
Never mind, you taking in them three dead bodies

285
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,010
and her to Red Rock to get paid, ain't ya'?

286
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,660
Yeah.

287
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
Well...

288
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,220
the man is red Rock suppose to pay you is me. The new sherrif.

289
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,400
So if you wanna get paid, you need to get me to Red Rock.

290
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,410
Well execuse me for finding it hard to belive a

291
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,470
town electing you to do anything except drop dead.

292
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,210
So I'm suppose to freeze death, 'cause you find something hard to belive?

293
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,160
No I suppose not.

294
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,220
Put them on and come inside.

295
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,950
No.

296
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,160
- Then you'll freeze.
- Then you'll hang.

297
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,740
How so?

298
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,700
Stay strong Driver!

299
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,700
Could you come down here and join us?

300
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,970
I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here.

301
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,060
You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?

302
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Yeah.

303
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,130
Red Rock is my town.

304
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,630
And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains? No Sir!

305
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,560
Sorry bushwackers, I ain't entering Red Rock that way.

306
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,280
When you finally get to Red Rock, you're going

307
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,010
to realize every goddamn thing I said was right.

308
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,200
And I expect you, O.B.,

309
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,820
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock that John

310
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,390
Ruth, let their new sheriff freeze to death.

311
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,550
There ain't no bounty on my head, bushwacker.

312
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,490
You let me die, that's murder.

313
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,780
Hold out your hands.

314
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,790
O.B.

315
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Give the Major back his iron.

316
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,320
One thing I know for sure,

317
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,380
this nigger-hating son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.

318
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Now...

319
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,990
I'll help protect your eight thousand,

320
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,440
you help me protect my ten,

321
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,030
deal?

322
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,130
Ain't love grand.

323
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,880
Y'all wanna' lie on the ground and make snow angels together?

324
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
- Tell ya' what, Bob... The name's John.

325
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,020
When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and Major Marquis there dinner and booze.

326
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,790
- May way of saying thanks.
- I don't drink,

327
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,740
with rebel renegades, and I damn sure don't break bread with them.

328
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,690
Well Mr. Ruth,

329
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,280
you sound like you got a axe to grind against The Cause.

330
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,580
The cause of a renegade army?

331
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,470
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.

332
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,470
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the Rebel Flag

333
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,710
as an excuse to kill and steal.

334
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,320
And this should interest you Warren, in particular emancipated blacks.

335
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,640
Sounds like my kinda' fella'.

336
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,930
Sounds to me you been reading a lotta' newspapers printed in Washin'ton D.C.

337
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,190
Anywho, I'm just trying to let y'all know grateful I am.

338
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,540
I was a goner, and y'all saved me.

339
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,360
You wanna' show me how grateful you are...

340
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
shut up!

341
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,090
God damnit, Daisy it's coming.

342
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,810
Here, last piece.

343
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,970
Does he know how famous you once was?

344
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,460
I don't think so.

345
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,670
Black eye.

346
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,980
Do you know who he is?

347
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,500
Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward

348
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,710
the Confederacy put on the head of Major Marquis?

349
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,830
Yeah.

350
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,410
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,

351
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,720
but they never did get them the right nigger head, did they?

352
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,490
No they didn't.

353
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,590
But it wasn't for lack of trying.

354
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,060
Them peckawoods left their homes and their families,

355
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,420
and come to this snowy mountain,

356
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,550
looking for me and fortune.

357
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,250
None of them found fortune.

358
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,190
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,

359
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,050
they found me.

360
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,770
Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war.

361
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,390
Once passions had cold, it dropped down to eight, then five.

362
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,320
But, I bet even when it was five thousand,

363
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,820
you had your share of country boys coming to call?

364
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,160
You know I did.

365
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,740
Why did they have a reward on you?

366
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,590
The Confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them.

367
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,040
After I broke out of Wellenbeck,

368
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,630
The South took my continued existence as a personal affront.

369
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,870
So The Cause put a reward on my head.

370
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,130
What's...

371
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,950
Wellenbeck?

372
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,030
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?

373
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,150
No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!

374
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,810
You bust out?

375
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,350
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.

376
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,810
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea. So bright...

377
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,660
you got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before.

378
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,330
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.

379
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,030
Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling.

380
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,030
So I burnt it down.

381
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,730
There was a rookie regiment spending the overnight in that camp.

382
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,620
Forty-seven men... burnt to a crisp.

383
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,330
Southern youth, farmer's sons,

384
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,830
- cream of the crop... And I say, "Let them burn".

385
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm suppose to apologize for killing Johnny Reb?

386
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,790
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.

387
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,500
I joined the war to kill White Southern.

388
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,590
Crackers And that means kill them anyway I can.

389
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,300
Shoot them. Stab them. Drown them. Burn them.

390
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,140
Drop a big ole' rock on their head.

391
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,770
Whatever it took to put White Southern Crackers in the ground

392
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,960
that's what I joined the war to do, and that's what I did.

393
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,920
To answer your question, John Ruth,

394
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,660
when Major Marquis burned forty seven men alive,

395
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,540
for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees,

396
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,280
that's when The South put a reward on the head of Major Marquis.

397
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,180
And I made them trees, Mannix.

398
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,920
And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed The Northern Line.

399
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,050
But you had a surprise waiting for you on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?

400
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,580
See once they started pulling out all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

401
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,850
seems not all of them boys were Rebs.

402
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,530
You burnt up some of your own boys, didn't ya' Major?

403
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,030
How many burnt prisoners they end up finding?

404
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,730
Wasn't the final Yankee death count something like thirty-seven?

405
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,470
That's the thing about war Mannix,

406
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,590
people die.

407
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,020
So ya' chalking it up to "War Is Hell", ha?

408
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,570
Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with. But if memory serves,

409
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,150
your side didn't look at it that way.

410
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,440
I think they thought, thirty-seven white men for one nigger

411
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,420
wasn't so hot a trade.

412
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,660
I belive they accused you

413
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,790
of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks

414
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,170
and the whole Blue and Grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.

415
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,160
And that's why they drummed your black ass outta'

416
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,000
the Cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back.

417
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,570
Isn't it Major?

418
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,870
Horse shit.

419
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,490
If he did all that, the Cavalry woulda' shot him.

420
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,650
I didn't say they could prove it.

421
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,710
But they sure did think it out loud, didn't they Major?

422
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,910
But,

423
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,130
Warren's war record was stellar, and that's what saved his ass.

424
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,740
Are you killed yourself your share of

425
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,180
redskins in your day, didn't ya' Black Major?

426
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,650
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

427
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,900
I'll tell a' what The Cavalry didn't look kindly on.

428
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,670
Mannix's Marauders that's what.

429
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,170
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy

430
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,170
would talk about anybody else's behavior

431
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,490
during war time makes me wanna horse laugh.

432
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,160
Don't you say anything about my daddy,

433
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,610
what he fought for,

434
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,110
was dignity in defeat, and against the unconditional surrender.

435
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,160
We weren't foreign barbarians pounding on the city walls.

436
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,450
We were your brothers.

437
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,800
- We deserved dignity in defeat.
- Just,

438
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,390
how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat?

439
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,380
My faire share, Black Major.

440
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,760
'Cuz when niggers are scared, that's when white folks are safe.

441
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,880
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk,

442
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,980
you ride up top wtih O.B.

443
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:28,650
No no no, you got me talking politics

444
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,210
I didn't wanna'.

445
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,940
Like I said y'all, I'm just happy to be alive.

446
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,430
I...

447
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,840
I think I'll just look out this winda'

448
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,000
let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep.

449
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,050
And dream about how lucky I am.

450
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,080
Chapter Three Minnie's Haberdashery.

451
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,970
Get in there.

452
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Easy.

453
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,870
What the hell's going on,

454
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,860
we weren't expecting another stage tonight!

455
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,610
I can see you already got another one up in here.

456
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,720
I just got through putting the horses away.

457
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,660
This ain't the normal line.

458
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,250
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,

459
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,110
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

460
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,000
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

461
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,030
They ain't here. I'm running the place while they're gone.

462
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,100
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

463
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,730
He says they ain't here. He's looking after the place while they gone.

464
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,420
Who are you?

465
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,090
I'm Bob.

466
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,970
Well whoever you are, help O.B. with the horses.

467
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,030
Get them outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's them.

468
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,940
I just put those other horses away. You need it done fast, you need to help.

469
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,970
I got two of my best men on it.

470
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,670
You heard him freeloaders, get to work.

471
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,640
Come on let's go!

472
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,150
- Open up!
- Kick it open!

473
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,400
- What?
- Kick it open!

474
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,430
Shut that door, there's a goddamn blizzard out there!

475
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,780
- You gotta' nail it shut!
- You have to nail it shut!

476
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,050
- Hold it shut!
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!

477
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,400
You have to nail it shut! There's a hammer and nails by the door!

478
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,960
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

479
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,220
You need to do two pieces of wood! One ain't good enough!

480
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,850
- Two pieces of wood.
- That fucking thing is busted!

481
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,990
Not just one piece of wood.

482
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,130
- Gimme that other piece of wood.
- Yeah, allright.

483
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,580
- Gimme the nail.
- Here.

484
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Jesus.

485
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,640
That door's a son of a gun.

486
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,520
Who's the idiot who broke that, that Mexican fella'?

487
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,280
Good heavens,

488
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,910
a woman

489
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,010
out in this white hell. You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

490
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,620
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.

491
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,050
When did you fella's arrive?

492
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,580
About forty minutes ago.

493
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,640
The Cowboy fella' in the corner, is that your driver?

494
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,690
No he's a passenger.

495
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,690
The driver lit out. He said he was going to

496
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,670
spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend.

497
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,630
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

498
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,270
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella' do, soak his ole socks in the pot?

499
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,260
I think we all felt the same way, but were a little too polite to say something.

500
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,410
- He don't have that problem
- Where's the well water?

501
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,390
Over there.

502
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
So,

503
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,530
all three of you fellas' headed to Red Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?

504
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,560
Yes, all three of us were on that stagecouach out there.

505
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,870
Coffee beans?

506
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,990
Over there.

507
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,340
Get your hand outta' there.

508
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,780
The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with us.

509
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,310
Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.

510
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,400
If he is a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.

511
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,360
Good.

512
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,040
Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable.

513
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
So...

514
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,600
the new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with you?

515
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,520
No he's lying

516
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,150
he ain't sheriff of nothing.

517
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,400
He's a southern renegade.

518
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,500
He's just talking his self outta' freezing to death, is all.

519
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,870
What the fuck I tell you about talking, huh?

520
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,250
I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck!

521
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,570
You never gave your name, sir.

522
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,520
John Ruth.

523
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,350
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm taking her to the law.

524
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,190
- You're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, Buster.

525
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,540
- Do you have a warrant?
- 'Course I do.

526
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,230
May I see it?

527
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Why?

528
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,540
You're suppose to produce it upon request. How am I suppose to know,

529
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,430
you're not a villain,

530
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,780
kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession?

531
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,970
What's your name, Buster?

532
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,880
Well...

533
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,660
it certainly isn't Buster.

534
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,650
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

535
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,660
- Oswaldo?
- Yes.

536
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,370
Well...

537
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,290
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

538
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,280
- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?
- Yeah it's her.

539
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,480
- It says here, Dead or Alive?
- Yeah it does.

540
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,600
Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her

541
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,900
sounds like hard work. Wouldn't transporting her be easier

542
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,170
if she were dead?

543
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,030
No one said the job was suppose to be easy.

544
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,340
And why is her hanging proper, so important to you?

545
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,510
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.

546
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,370
Well I appreciate that.

547
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,710
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

548
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,130
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

549
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,580
The Hangman in these parts.

550
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,260
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- So it would appear.

551
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,220
Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers?

552
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,280
No I can't say I have.

553
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,170
Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to my prisoner, that's it. You got it?

554
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,380
I got I got. Jolly good.

555
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,370
You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up?

556
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,670
The Bar is open, follow moi.

557
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,830
All right.

558
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,090
All right.

559
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,320
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!

560
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,620
I'll feed and water the horses. You go inside and get some hot coffee.

561
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,290
I've got some stew cooking. Should be done soon.

562
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,350
Now look...

563
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,490
now matter how bad this blizzard gets,

564
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:57,780
we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time.

565
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,830
So me an' Chris better lay out a line

566
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,070
from the stable to the front door, and from the front door to the shithouse.

567
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
Okay?

568
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,980
Good idea.

569
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,160
Come on, Chris.

570
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,910
I'll give you a hand.

571
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,520
No no no, go inside, get warm.

572
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,780
You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?

573
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,830
You're right, mi amigo.

574
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,730
Muchas gracias.

575
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,170
All right, follow me.

576
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,460
We gonna' drop one, every ten paces.

577
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,330
- From here to the door.
- Yeah!
- All right.

578
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:58,640
Now, you're wanted for murder.

579
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,960
For the sake of my analogy, let's just assume that you did it.

580
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,070
John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock to stand trail for murder.

581
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,950
And, if... you're found guilty,

582
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:15,620
the people of Red Rock will hang you in the town square. And as the hangman,

583
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,780
I will perform the execution.

584
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,270
And if all those things end up taking place,

585
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,250
that's what civilized society calls "justice".

586
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,390
However,

587
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,680
if the relatives and the loved ones of the person

588
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,020
you murdered were outside that door right now.

589
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,330
And after busting down that door, they drug you out

590
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,130
in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that,

591
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,820
we would be frontier justice.

592
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,500
Now the good part

593
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,690
about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching.

594
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,500
The bad part is it's apt to be Wrong as Right.

595
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,470
Not in your case. In your case, you'd have it

596
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,270
coming. But other people, maybe not so much.

597
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:12,850
But ultimately what's the real difference between the two?

598
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,410
The real difference is Me... The Hangman.

599
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,180
To me, it dosen't matter what you did. When I hang you, I

600
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,720
will get no satisfaction from your death. It's my job.

601
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,850
I hang you in red Rock,

602
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:29,690
I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there.

603
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,360
The man who pulls the lever,

604
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,640
that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man.

605
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,820
And that dispassion is the very essence of

606
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:46,170
justice. For justice delivered without dispassion,

607
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,640
is always in danger of not being justice.

608
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,970
Amen.

609
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,810
No offense cowboy fella', just getting your attention.

610
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,110
Yeah, well...

611
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,670
you got it.

612
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,100
What'cha writing firend?

613
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,450
- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
- What's that?

614
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,610
My life story.

615
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,150
- You're writing your life story?
- You bet I am.

616
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,750
Am I in it?

617
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,070
You just entered.

618
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,820
Well you like writing stories so much, why don't

619
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,820
you tell me the story that brings you here?

620
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,460
- Who's asking?
- I am.

621
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,020
John Ruth. I'm bringing in this one to Red Rock to hang.

622
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,380
Ain't no way I'm spending a coupla' nights under a

623
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,610
roof with somebody I don't know who you they are.

624
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,190
And I don't know who you are. So...

625
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,090
who are you?

626
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,110
- Joe Gage.
- What?

627
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,720
That's my name, Joe Gage.

628
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,500
Okay Joe Gage, why you going to Red Rock?

629
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,720
- I ain't going to Red Rock.
- Where you going?

630
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,620
- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.
- What's there?

631
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,880
My mother.

632
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,630
Your mother?

633
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,860
Listen, I'm just a cow puncher I just...

634
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,220
I got back from a long drive and...

635
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,120
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,

636
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,440
I was a partner.

637
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,330
For the first time in my life I,

638
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,080
made a pretty penny and, eh...

639
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,210
Come home and spend time with my mother for Christmas.

640
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,330
Now that's funny.

641
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,180
'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type.

642
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,140
Yeah, well...

643
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,800
you know, looks can be deceiving.

644
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,150
Because I definitely am a...

645
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,560
coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type.

646
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,620
Christmas with Mother? I mean...

647
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,020
it's a wonderful thing.

648
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,290
Now is that... good enough for you?

649
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,670
John Ruth?

650
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,610
For now.

651
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,130
Just steer clear of my prisoner.

652
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,110
Hello old timer.

653
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,110
General.

654
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,800
General.

655
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,890
You sir,

656
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,390
are a Hyena.

657
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,270
And I have no wish to speak to you.

658
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,680
I've been called worse.

659
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,760
Fair enough, General.

660
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,850
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,750
- You gonna' kick it open.
- Kick it open.

662
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,400
It's already cold enough in here.

663
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,770
It dosen't have latch you gonna' hammer up a board.

664
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,450
You gotta' nail it shut!

665
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,580
- The hammer and nails is by the door.
- There is a hammer and nails right there!

666
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,070
Oh god,

667
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,580
- Holding this Chris.
- Here, here.

668
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,230
You need to nail it in!

669
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,870
You need two pieces of wood. You gotta' hammer another one.

670
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,120
One ain't good enough! It's gonna' blow right open.

671
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,490
- Goddamn it!
- It's gotta' open if you don't.

672
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:15,090
- Shut up!
- I got it! Son of a bitch!

673
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,380
Jesis Christ, that door's a whore!

674
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,080
I get it, haberdashery,

675
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,520
that was a joke.

676
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,190
How's the coffy?

677
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,560
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.

678
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,590
Thank you.

679
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,600
Guess who he is?

680
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,690
Buffalo Bill?

681
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,700
Hardly, no.

682
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,060
I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The...

683
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,700
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

684
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,100
- Oh, you are?
- Yes I am.

685
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,700
Well good to meet you Mr.?

686
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,070
- Mobray.
- Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix,

687
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,260
- the new sheriff in Red Rock.
- Really?

688
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,860
Horseshit!

689
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,720
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!

690
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,750
Fella' warming himself by the that pot by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.

691
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,540
That's the only thing you said that's the truth.

692
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,270
You coming into Red Rock to hang Lance Lawson?

693
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,970
Precisely.

694
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,420
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my bag.

695
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,350
- May I see them?
- Of course.

696
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,050
Who's Lance Lawson?

697
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,320
He's a fell' been sitting in the Red Rock jail about a month now.

698
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,320
He's the fella
- who shot the fella'
- who was sheriff 'fore me.

699
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,060
Precisely.

700
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,560
What did she mean when she said,

701
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,040
bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable?

702
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,150
He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable.

703
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,220
But all that just to guard her?

704
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,030
I don't think that was the original idea, but...

705
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,880
that's the idea now.

706
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,220
- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?
- Yeah.

707
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,010
Five of you?

708
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,660
Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery

709
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,530
is about to get cozy for the next few days.

710
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,080
Yes it does.

711
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,150
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?

712
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,650
The Lincoln what?

713
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,180
The letter from Abraham Lincoln.

714
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,820
President Abraham Lincoln?

715
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,800
- Weren't you pen pals?
- With the President?

716
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,660
I'm sorry, I heard somebody in your party had a

717
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,840
letter from Abraham Lincoln, I assumed it was you.

718
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,480
Not him!

719
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,090
The black fella' in the stable.

720
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:32,330
The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

721
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,960
Yeah.

722
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,450
The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

723
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,530
Say your name was again?

724
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,400
- Bob.
- Warren.

725
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,300
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

726
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,630
Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain.

727
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,230
- What?
- Yeah.

728
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,340
- They ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.

729
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,800
- Her mother?
- Yes.

730
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,490
I never knew Minnie had a mother.

731
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,070
Everybody's got a mother.

732
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,950
Yeah, I suppose.

733
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,280
- And she left you in charge?
- Si.

734
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,470
That sure don't sound like Minnie.

735
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,840
Are you calling me a liar?

736
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,190
Not yet, I ain't.

737
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,020
- But it sounds peculiar, though,
- What sound peculiar?

738
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,630
Well first of, Minnie never struck me as the sentimental type.

739
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,900
Secondly,

740
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,980
I can't imagine Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

741
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,080
outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water,

742
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,770
unless Minnie was laying a frying pan upside his head.

743
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,280
Along taking trips to the north side.

744
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,690
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar, mi negro amigo.

745
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,930
Yeah it do sound a whole lot like, don't it?

746
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,980
But I still haven't done it yet.

747
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,260
Minnie still serve food?

748
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:25,000
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.
- Then we serve food.

749
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,980
She still stinking up the place with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?

750
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,700
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.

751
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,200
She rolls her own.

752
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,850
"Red Apple Tobacco."

753
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:44,690
But mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.

754
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,410
Yeah I do, Senor Bob.

755
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,960
Just seeing if you do.

756
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,330
- Fill me up, O.B.
- Yeah.

757
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,540
Goddamn it!

758
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,230
Thank you.

759
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,930
Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty...

760
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,550
is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?

761
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,770
You've got a good eye son.

762
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,870
Well, I'll be double dogged damned!

763
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:08,480
General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!

764
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,520
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.

765
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,710
- Erskine's boy?
- Yes sir.

766
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,480
May I sit down, Sir?

767
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,120
According to the Yankees, it's a free country.

768
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,510
Genaral Sandy Smithers...

769
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,680
boy...

770
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,160
oh boy.

771
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,680
Did my daddy talk about you.

772
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,670
I heard you gave those Blue Bellies sweet hell.

773
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,440
Me and my boys did our part.

774
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,370
Just like Erskine and his boys did their part.

775
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,500
Hell yeah, we did.

776
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,960
- Yankees sons of bitches?
- I never knew your father, son.

777
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,700
But, I always respected his resolve.

778
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:59,230
Thank you for saying that, General. Your respect woulda' meant the world to him.

779
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,540
Can I get ya' some coffy?

780
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,140
- That would be nice.
- Well, how about a blanked?

781
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,360
That would be even nicer.

782
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,410
Hell, you know what, you can have mine.

783
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,350
Here we go General.

784
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:25,870
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir? If ya' don't mind me asking?

785
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,430
My boy.

786
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,860
You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?

787
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,760
My son, Chester Charles Smithers,

788
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,340
he died out here a few years back.

789
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,460
Forgive me sir.

790
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,040
No forgiveness needed, son.

791
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,310
Like I said, it was a few years back.

792
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,050
It was after he served his service.

793
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,780
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,

794
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,380
to make his fortune.

795
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,260
Never to be heard from again.

796
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,520
I bought him a symbolic plot

797
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,200
in the Red Rock cemetery.

798
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,510
I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone.

799
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,280
Was he a goner fer' sure?

800
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,870
No chance he could be living "the cold life" out in

801
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,140
the woods? It's a rough life, but folks can learn it.

802
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:33,270
If he had done what he came here to do,

803
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,250
he'd a come home.

804
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,920
Close it, close it!

805
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,310
You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut!

806
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,920
Really? Who's the idiot who broke the damn door?

807
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,210
Fucking hold it low.

808
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,860
Okay.

809
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,200
Hold it, mi negro amigo.

810
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,460
We need two pieces of wood.

811
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,860
Ola mi cabron.

812
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,160
There you go, motherfucker!

813
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,440
- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?
- Huh?

814
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,850
Considering Minnie's no hats indoors policy? Which,

815
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,760
If I remember it correctly, that was one of them Bar of Iron rules,

816
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,430
kinda rule, she'd want kept up in her absence.

817
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:44,010
You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats.

818
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:45,800
I'm guilty.

819
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,140
I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats.

820
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,580
How about we forget about the hats today,

821
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,320
considering there's a blizzard going on and all,

822
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,490
and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?

823
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,950
A large black dog.

824
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,220
Labrador.

825
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,850
You know my daddy, I said that my daddy!

826
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,140
Always said that Davis was a courages man.

827
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:33,210
But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond.

828
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,140
Yes, Sir.

829
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,430
I agree with that the army in North Virginia would've been used in a...

830
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,990
I said the army of North Virginia

831
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,950
would have been used in very different way.

832
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,930
Shut up!

833
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,590
OB
O.B.?

834
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,770
Do you know that nigger, Sir?

835
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,780
I don't know that nigger.

836
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,230
But I know he's a nigger.

837
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,360
And that's all I need to know.

838
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,910
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.

839
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:26,040
- That nigger is...
- General Sanford Smithers?

840
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,840
Battle of Baton Rouge?

841
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:36,620
Inform the nigger in the Cavalry officers uniform

842
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:41,760
that I had a division of Confederates under my commend,

843
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,940
in Baton Rouge.

844
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,720
Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to inform you...

845
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,030
I heard them hillbilly.

846
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:53,870
Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also.

847
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,900
On the other side.

848
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,670
Oh that's interesting.

849
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:03,310
General Smithers, he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.

850
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:07,420
- On the other...
- Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger,

851
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,660
that I don't acknowledge niggers in Northern uniforms.

852
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,960
You captured a whole Colored Command that day.

853
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,660
But not one Colored Trooper made it to a camp, did they?

854
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,360
We had neither the time or the food.

855
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,260
Nor the inclination to care for Northern horses,

856
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,290
and least of all Northern niggers.

857
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:35,300
- So we shot them where they stood.
- Gentlemen,

858
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,120
Gentlemen,

859
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,410
I know Americans aren't apt

860
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:47,090
to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war.

861
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:51,980
But I strongly suggest we don't restage The Battle of Baton Rouge,

862
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,640
during a blizzard in Minnie's Haberdashery.

863
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,700
Now, my Nubian friend,

864
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:05,620
while I realize passions are high, that was a while ago.

865
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,840
And if you shoot this un-armed old man I guarantee

866
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,740
I will hang you by the neck until you are dead.

867
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,260
Once we arrive in Red Rock.

868
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,690
I damn will guarantee that too.

869
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,500
Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men.

870
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,340
You can kick them down the stairs and say it's

871
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,840
a accident, but ya' can't just shoot them.

872
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,970
Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here,

873
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,210
close together like for a few days,

874
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:44,780
may I suggest a possible solution?

875
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,210
We divide Minnie's in half.

876
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,430
The Northern side and The Southern Side.

877
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,880
With the dinner table

878
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,160
operating as a neutral territory.

879
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,850
We could say that the fireplace side of the room,

880
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:10,020
acts as a symbolic representative of...

881
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,890
Georgia.

882
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,520
While the bar, represents...

883
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,130
Philadelphia!

884
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:27,140
As long as the bar's Philadelphia I agree.

885
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,230
We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon?

886
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,880
I help you protect your eight thousand,

887
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,970
you help me protect my ten yeah I suppose.

888
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:51,430
One of them fella's is not what he says he is.

889
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,370
What is he?

890
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:56,680
He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is.

891
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,590
One of them, maybe even two of them, is here to see Domergue goes free.

892
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:07,470
And to accomplish that goal, they'll kill everbody in here.

893
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:11,220
And they got them coupla' days. So all they gotta' do

894
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,750
is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity.

895
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:18,000
And that's when they strike,

896
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,100
huh bitch?

897
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,830
If you say so, John.

898
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,160
Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?

899
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,490
Our best bet is this,

900
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:34,730
duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.

901
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:40,240
He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait.

902
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:46,130
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing it's the right one, isn't so easy.

903
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:49,920
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.

904
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,530
He'll try and create his opportunity. And that's when Mr. Jumpy reveals himself.

905
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,160
And what do you got to say about all this?

906
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:02,300
What do I got to say? About John Ruth's ravings?

907
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,560
He's absolutely right.

908
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,410
Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots. And

909
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:14,170
we're just waiting for everybody go to sleep.

910
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:18,310
That's when we gonna' kill y'all.

911
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,760
Okay everybody,

912
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,920
hear this.

913
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:31,250
This here is Daisy Domergue.

914
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,910
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

915
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,780
Ten thousand dollars.

916
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,020
That money's mine boys.

917
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,580
Don't wanna' share it.

918
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,620
I ain't gonna' lose it.

919
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:52,800
When the sun comes out, I'm taking this woman into Red Rock, to hang.

920
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,070
Now...

921
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,690
is there anybody here...

922
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,790
comitted to stopping me...

923
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,390
from doing that?

924
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,370
Really?

925
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,970
Nobody gotta' problem with this?

926
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:37,530
Well, I guess that's very fortunate for me.

927
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:42,770
However, I hope you all understand,

928
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:46,900
I can't just take your word.

929
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:52,090
Circumstances force me to, take...

930
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:55,070
precautions.

931
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:59,820
When you say precautions...

932
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,560
why do I feel you mean me?

933
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,730
- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
- You are?
- Yes I am.

934
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:12,590
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

935
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:15,200
The Hangman got himself a gun too?

936
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:19,010
I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours.

937
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,880
I feel kinda' naked without it.

938
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,340
Oh, I still got mine.

939
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,730
I'll protect you.

940
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:49,530
A bastards work is never done, huh, John Ruth?

941
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,990
That's right, Joe Gage.

942
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:56,540
- Now gimmie the gun.
- You want it?

943
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,530
You have to come and take...

944
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,490
Calm down.

945
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,620
Take your hand away from your gun.

946
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,600
Blink if you're calm.

947
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:16,630
- Did he blink?
- He blinked.

948
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:20,450
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?

949
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:26,970
- He blinked.
- Take his pistol.

950
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:32,510
I'm real sorry about this, son.

951
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:38,250
Like I said, nothing personal. Just a precaution.

952
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,900
Pretty sneaky.

953
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:04,680
I'm afraid the same applies to you too, Mr.

954
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,190
Mobray.

955
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:11,640
Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose.

956
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,450
Hand me that little bucket.

957
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:29,820
OB
O.B.?

958
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,350
Go to the outhouse.

959
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:38,520
Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole.

960
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,040
Why do I gotta' go outside?

961
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:46,310
Your jacket's already on. And I sorta kinda trust you.

962
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,480
After you Major.

963
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:46,060
Okay.

964
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,900
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.

965
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,890
Don't get any ideas, I ain't going soft on ya'.

966
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,130
You lift your ass even one inch off this seat,

967
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:01,210
I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat.

968
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,140
So Domergue,

969
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:33,300
I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned.

970
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:37,450
- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?
- No I sure don't.

971
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,480
How 'bout you Oswaldo?

972
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,340
How about me what?

973
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,150
Look,

974
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:56,240
considering all the thing I done for money, I ain't one to judge.

975
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:02,040
But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hanging a woman?

976
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,380
Till they invent a trigger

977
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,460
a woman can't pull, if

978
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,590
you're a hang man, you're going to hang woman.

979
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:11,680
Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before.

980
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,230
When it comes to some of them mean bastards

981
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,740
out there it's the only thing does the job.

982
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,840
You really only need to hang mean bastards.

983
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,830
But mean bastards, you need to hang.

984
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,080
You goddamn son of a bitch!

985
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,640
I almost died out there!

986
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:46,950
I ain't never going out in that shit ever, ever again!

987
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,180
You okay, O.B.?

988
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,890
I'm fine.

989
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,810
I'll be fine.

990
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,560
I just need to get warm.

991
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,560
You want some stew, O.B.?

992
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,500
Stew, later.

993
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:34,850
That's nice.

994
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,360
So...

995
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,120
how you doing, black Major?

996
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,790
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix. Leave me be from your horseshit.

997
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:10,760
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?

998
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,160
I tole' you jackass to Hee-Haw somewhere else.

999
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:15,650
That's right, John.

1000
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:19,700
- You did say, didn't ya'?
- Yeah I did.

1001
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,420
So...

1002
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,840
- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
- Yes.

1003
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,230
The Abraham Lincoln?

1004
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,630
Yes.

1005
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,490
Abraham Lincoln The President of the United States.

1006
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:40,150
- Yes.
- Of America?
- Yes.

1007
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:44,720
- Wrote you a letter, personally?
- Yes.

1008
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,640
Personally? As in: "Dear Maj. Warren"?

1009
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,690
No. Personally as in: "Dear Marquis".

1010
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,560
"Dear Marquis"

1011
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,560
Abraham Lincoln the President of the United States of America?

1012
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,160
Yes.

1013
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,640
- May I see it?
- No you may not.

1014
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,910
But the way John tells it, you weren't just some

1015
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,330
random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters.

1016
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,520
Way John tells it,

1017
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,500
- y'all hada' correspondence?-Yes.

1018
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:18,010
Way John tells it, y'all's practically pen pals?

1019
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,180
Yes.

1020
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,980
And a pen pal's...

1021
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,160
practically a friend.

1022
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,020
John Ruth,

1023
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,870
you really think a nigger drummed outta' the.

1024
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,570
Calvary with a yellow stripe down his back,

1025
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:49,410
was practically friends with The President of The United States of America?

1026
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,880
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to ya'

1027
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,000
but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery,

1028
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,210
had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,

1029
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:04,960
Least of all, that nigger there.

1030
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,130
Was all that horseshit?

1031
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,960
Course it was.

1032
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,960
Well I guess it's true what they say about you people.

1033
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:57,220
You can't trust a fucking word that comes outta' your mouth.

1034
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,950
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1035
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,340
I hurt your feelings?

1036
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:06,870
As a matter of fact, you did.

1037
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,010
I know,

1038
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,890
I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met,

1039
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,970
so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.

1040
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:22,170
But you got no idea, what it's like being a black man facing down America.

1041
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,240
The only time black folks are safe,

1042
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,850
is when white folks is disarmed. And this letter,

1043
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:33,770
had the desired effect of disarming white folks.

1044
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,880
Call it what you want,

1045
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,810
I call it a dirty fucking trick.

1046
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,490
You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man?

1047
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,880
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.

1048
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:13,730
Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John,

1049
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:18,070
a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me.

1050
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,680
- I might let a whore piss on it.
- I spit on it.

1051
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,480
Good for you, sister.

1052
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,630
Warren goddamit, you leave that old man alone!

1053
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:49,430
Stand down you son of a bitch, I shared a battle field with this man.

1054
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:52,010
Or would you deny me that too?

1055
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:58,550
I suppose you were there.

1056
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,650
May I join you?

1057
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,570
Yes you may.

1058
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,590
Damn it.

1059
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,850
So,

1060
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,250
how's life since the war?

1061
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:16,050
Got both my legs.

1062
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:19,290
Got both my arms.

1063
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,990
- I can't complain.
- Got a woman?

1064
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,230
Fever took her, started this last winter.

1065
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,000
What was her name?

1066
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:36,010
- Betsy.
- Georgia girl?

1067
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,250
Augusta.

1068
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,620
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.

1069
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,930
I use to raise Kentucky horses.

1070
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:53,130
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies.

1071
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,670
God damnit.

1072
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:59,810
I made good deal on her.

1073
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:04,190
Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach orchards.

1074
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,570
Set myself up pretty well.

1075
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:11,560
Did a hell a lot better than my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.

1076
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,660
Yeah, your boy came up here a few years back.

1077
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,610
He spoke highly of his mama too.

1078
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:26,050
You knew my boy?

1079
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:28,300
Did I know him? Yeah...

1080
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,110
Yeah I knew them.

1081
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:34,570
You did not know my boy.

1082
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,920
Suit yourself.

1083
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,470
Didja' know my son?

1084
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:51,090
- I know the day he died, do you?
- No.

1085
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:54,270
- You wanna know what day that was?
- Yes.

1086
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:03,300
The day he met me.

1087
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:22,060
He came up here to do a little nigger head hunting.

1088
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:27,720
By then the reward was so, five thousand and bragging rights.

1089
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,670
But back then to battle hard rebs, five thousand just to cut off a niggers head,

1090
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,710
now that's good money.

1091
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:42,000
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain, looking for fortune.

1092
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:46,140
But there was no fortune to be found.

1093
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,590
All they found was me.

1094
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,360
All them fella's came up here sang a different tune,

1095
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:59,490
when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,

1096
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:04,040
"Let's just forget it.

1097
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,980
I go my way, you go yours"

1098
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:11,660
- that's your boy Chester talking
- You a goddamn lie.

1099
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,680
"If you just let me home to my family, I'll

1100
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:19,780
swear, I'll never set foot in Wyoming again."

1101
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:25,300
That's what they all said.

1102
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,840
Begging for his life.

1103
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,750
Your boy told me his whole life story.

1104
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:41,820
And you was in that story, General.

1105
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,980
And when I knew me I had the son.

1106
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:52,080
Of The Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge...

1107
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:57,350
- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.
- You shut your lying nigger lips up!

1108
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:01,530
General Smithers, don't you listen to him, he didn't know your boy!

1109
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:04,730
He just heard, tell why you here is all!

1110
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:08,550
It was cold the day I killed your boy.

1111
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:14,780
And I don't mean snowy mountain in Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.

1112
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,200
And on that cold day,

1113
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:22,050
with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel...

1114
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:24,410
I made him strip.

1115
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:28,880
Right down to his bare ass.

1116
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:33,550
Then I told him to start walking.

1117
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:06,200
I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him.

1118
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,540
- You never even knew my boy?
- No he didn't!

1119
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:17,110
He's just a sneaky nigger trying to getcha to go for that gun!

1120
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:20,680
Then he commits to begging again.

1121
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,190
But this time he wasn't begging to go home.

1122
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,230
He knew he'd never see his home again. And he wasn't begging for his life neither.

1123
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:33,880
'Cos he knew that was long gone.

1124
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,620
All he wanted... was a blanket.

1125
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:43,480
Now don't judge your boy too harshly, General. You

1126
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:47,030
ain't never been cold as your boy was that day.

1127
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:56,480
You'd be surprised what a man that cold, would do for a blanket.

1128
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,520
Wanna know what your boy did?

1129
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:07,660
I took my big, black, pecker outta' my pants.

1130
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,920
And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it.

1131
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,500
Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head...

1132
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:37,140
Then I stuck my big, black Johnson right down his goddamn throat.

1133
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,980
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.

1134
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:46,420
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.

1135
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:50,030
And Chester Charles Smithers,

1136
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:56,730
sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could.

1137
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,240
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?

1138
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,060
Your boy...

1139
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,440
black dudes dingus in his mouth.

1140
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,100
Him shaking, him crying

1141
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,880
me laughing

1142
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:27,000
and him not understanding.

1143
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,030
But you understand, doncha' Sandy?

1144
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:35,020
I never did give your boy that blanket.

1145
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:42,510
Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked.

1146
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,220
No blanket.

1147
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:50,680
That blanket was just a heart breaking liar's promise.

1148
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,470
Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers,

1149
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:58,310
that you chose not to acknowledge.

1150
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,110
So what you gonna' do old man?

1151
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,840
You gonna' spend the next two or three days,

1152
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,010
ignore the nigger that killed your boy,

1153
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:20,210
Ignoring how I made him suffer?

1154
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:23,520
Ignoring how I made him...

1155
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:28,750
lick, all over my Johnson?

1156
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,750
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...

1157
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:39,150
was to let me know... he was your boy.

1158
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:12,660
Chapter Four Domergue's Got a Secret.

1159
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:23,850
About fifteen minutes has passed, since we last left our characters.

1160
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,460
Joe Gag volunteered to take Smithers dead body outside.

1161
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:31,420
Straws we drawn to see who would help him...

1162
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:34,500
O.B. lost.

1163
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:35,840
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo,

1164
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,420
had vigorous debate about the legality of self-defense murder they just transpired.

1165
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,210
Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the

1166
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,650
legality of what just transpired, ignored them

1167
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:49,890
sat at a table by himself and drank brandy.

1168
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,280
Captain Chris Mannix dawn the dead Generals coat and

1169
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:57,960
joined Oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns.

1170
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,130
Hey Ozzy, hey you got the right idea.

1171
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,700
Let's light this place up.

1172
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:09,370
John Ruth held the door close, waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.

1173
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:17,470
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.

1174
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:24,680
Domergue, however,

1175
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,410
hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner

1176
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,910
table since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1177
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:30,150
John Ruth...

1178
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:32,610
Yeah?

1179
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,860
Can I play that guitar over there?

1180
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:38,090
Let's go back a bit.

1181
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:42,350
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.

1182
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,760
Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren

1183
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,420
shot General Smithers in front of everybody.

1184
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:50,930
But fourty seconds before that, something equally

1185
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,270
as important happened, but not everybody saw it.

1186
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,160
While Major Warren was captivating the crowd

1187
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:00,010
with tales of black dicks and white mouths...

1188
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:04,220
somebody... poisoned the coffy.

1189
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:09,100
He did everything I asked, no blanket.

1190
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,790
And the only one to see them do it...

1191
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,690
was Domergue.

1192
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,960
That's why this chapter is called...

1193
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,660
Domergue's Got a Secret.

1194
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,300
John Ruth.

1195
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,190
Yeah.

1196
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:40,680
Can I play that guitar over there?

1197
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:47,340
Yeah.

1198
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,580
You come back with anything else but a guitar.

1199
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,360
My pistol plays a tune.

1200
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:03,450
Domergues death march, you got it?

1201
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:07,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

1202
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:07,080
That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh?

1203
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,370
Yeah.

1204
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,650
It's kinda' pretty.

1205
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,780
- Got another verse to it?
- Yeah I got.

1206
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,620
Go ahead, sing it.

1207
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:08,800
Gimme that guitar!

1208
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,350
Music time's over!

1209
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,810
Turn around.

1210
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:30,760
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!

1211
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:19,310
When you get to hell, John.

1212
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:21,970
Tell them Daisy sent ya'.

1213
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:37,880
Mannix the coffy!

1214
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:33,520
Oh my god!

1215
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:39,340
Gimme that fucking gun!

1216
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:42,850
Don't test me, bitch.

1217
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:50,850
Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder.

1218
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:53,480
Goddammit.

1219
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,460
Get or don't get, Joe Gage. It's up to you.

1220
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:58,920
- I'll get.
- Then get.

1221
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,900
You too, Senor Bob.

1222
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,090
Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall.

1223
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,260
Move them down snowshoes.

1224
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:53,190
Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say.

1225
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:56,610
You open your mouth; You gonna' get a bullet.

1226
01:46:56,730 --> 01:47:01,890
You move a little sudden, a little strange; You gonna' get a bullet.

1227
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:06,260
Not a warning, not a question; A bullet.

1228
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:08,660
You got that?

1229
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,870
- Let me hear you say, "I got it".
- "I got it".

1230
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:14,330
- "I got it" "I got it".
- We have it.

1231
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:19,570
Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.

1232
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:21,380
Come on.

1233
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,220
Take this gun out of my holster.

1234
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,860
Point it at them.

1235
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:48,980
Like I said, anybody does anything. And I mean, anything.

1236
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:51,550
Kill them.

1237
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,340
So...

1238
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,160
you finally decided

1239
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,130
I'm telling the truth 'bout being the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?

1240
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:05,350
I don't know 'bout all that.

1241
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:08,340
But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy.

1242
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:10,950
'Cos you almost drunk it your own damn self.

1243
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:14,250
But one of them is.

1244
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:21,670
Gimme the key.

1245
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:23,800
Gimme the key!

1246
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,080
You motherfucking black bastard!

1247
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,100
You're gonna' die on this mountain

1248
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:44,060
and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!

1249
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,810
What I say 'bout talkin?

1250
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,000
'Meant it, didn't I?

1251
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:55,710
And you need to understand, you just killed the only

1252
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:59,330
man here, comitted to getting you to Red Rock alive.

1253
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:10,220
Now, one of y'all... is working with her.

1254
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:13,160
Or two of y'all is working with her.

1255
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,470
Or all y'all is...

1256
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:21,140
but only one of you poisoned the coffy.

1257
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:31,000
So what charms this bitch got, take a man brave a blizzard,

1258
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:38,240
kill in cold blood, I'm sure I don't know.

1259
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:43,750
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,

1260
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:49,690
so you kill him... okay maybe.

1261
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:52,810
But O.B. wasn't hanging nobody.

1262
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:54,290
He damn sure wouldn't.

1263
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:56,620
But he sure enough led over there dead now, though, ain't he?

1264
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:59,050
He damn sure is you sons of bitches.

1265
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:02,040
Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy.

1266
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:05,460
Like me god damnit.

1267
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:09,020
Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall

1268
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:12,770
don't practice in poison need to think about that.

1269
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:17,120
Think about how that coulda' you been you rolling around on this floor.

1270
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:20,750
And about the men standing next ta' ya' would be responsible.

1271
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:23,880
And I know who I got my money on.

1272
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,300
Yeah that's right Joe Gage I'm looking at you.

1273
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:34,320
Not so fast Chris. We'll get there.

1274
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:37,520
Let's slow it down.

1275
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:40,620
Let's slow it way down.

1276
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:47,910
Who made the coffy?

1277
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:49,580
He did.

1278
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,770
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1279
01:50:55,890 --> 01:51:00,700
But it's the stew that's got me thinking.

1280
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,770
How long you say Minnie been gone?

1281
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,780
A week?

1282
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,360
Si.

1283
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:13,570
See, my mama used to make stew.

1284
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:17,180
And it always tasted the same, no matter the meat.

1285
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,460
And there was another fellow on the plantation, Uncle Charly.

1286
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:24,150
He made stew too and like my mama's.

1287
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:28,440
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper,

1288
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:32,160
to I was a full grown man.

1289
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:37,940
And no matter the meat, it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

1290
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:42,090
Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six months,

1291
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,800
so I ain't no expert, but that,

1292
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:49,100
damn sure is Minnie's stew.

1293
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:54,090
So if Minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week,

1294
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:58,750
how'd she make the stew this morning?

1295
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,420
And this?

1296
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:08,010
This... is Sweet Dave's chair.

1297
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:11,670
When I sat in it earlier, I couldn't belive it.

1298
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:14,780
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

1299
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:20,330
This may be Minnie's place, but this is damn sure,

1300
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:23,760
Sweet Dave's chair.

1301
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:29,540
And if... he went to the north side...

1302
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:37,050
I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him.

1303
01:52:39,110 --> 01:52:41,080
What's in the chair?

1304
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,580
Just what I thought.

1305
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:46,980
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1306
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,990
So...

1307
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:57,610
are you actually accusing me of murder?

1308
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:03,150
The way I see it, Senior Bob,

1309
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:06,520
whoever's working with her,

1310
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:11,070
ain't who they say they is. And if it's you,

1311
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:15,140
that means Minnie and her man ain't at her mama's.

1312
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:18,840
They're lying out back there dead somewhere.

1313
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,140
Or if it's you British Man,

1314
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:24,060
the real Oswaldo Mobray is lying in a ditch somewhere. And

1315
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,660
you're just an English fella' passing off his papers.

1316
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:32,740
Or we go by my theory, which is the ugliest guy did it.

1317
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:36,240
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1318
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,840
So I take it you've deduced the coffy was

1319
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:43,750
poisoned while you were murdering the old man?

1320
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:45,570
Yes.

1321
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:50,280
Well, mi negro amigo, during that whole incident...

1322
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:55,090
I was sitting on that side of the room. Playing Silent Night on the piano.

1323
01:53:55,210 --> 01:54:01,780
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy. I said you didn't make the stew.

1324
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:05,770
My theory is...

1325
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:10,920
you're working with man who poisoned the coffy.

1326
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,530
And both of y'all murdered Minnie,

1327
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:16,650
and Sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck

1328
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:19,440
day to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this morning.

1329
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,840
And at some point,

1330
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:27,560
y'all intended to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.

1331
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:37,050
But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us.

1332
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,880
That's as far as I got. How am I doing?

1333
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:49,890
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?

1334
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:55,570
So, do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory?

1335
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:57,060
Or can you prove it, cabrone?

1336
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:04,230
It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.

1337
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:08,600
And it's a little bit more then my theory.

1338
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,940
How long you say you been working for Minnie's?

1339
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:18,150
Four months.

1340
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:21,560
If you would have been here two and half years ago

1341
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:24,670
you'd know about the sign used to hang above the bar.

1342
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:30,670
- Minnie mentioned that to you?
- No.

1343
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:34,680
You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?

1344
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:39,270
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

1345
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:46,890
Minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this Habadashery.

1346
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:50,000
And it hung over that Bar every day till she

1347
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:52,680
took down, a little over two years ago.

1348
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:58,400
You know why she took it down?

1349
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:01,060
She started letting in dogs.

1350
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:12,650
Now Minnie likes just about everybody, but she sure don't like Mexicans.

1351
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:18,600
So when you tell me, Minnie went to North side to visit her mama?

1352
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:24,930
Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay, maybe.

1353
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:29,370
But when you tell me Minnie Mink took The Habadashery,

1354
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:33,230
the most precious thing to her in the whole world,

1355
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:40,780
and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?

1356
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:45,650
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said:

1357
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:47,080
"That sure don't sound like Minnie".

1358
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:53,650
Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.

1359
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:58,780
And if you lyin, which you are,

1360
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:03,440
then you killed Minnie... and Sweet Dave.

1361
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:26,410
Four measly bulltes and there goes Senior, Bob.

1362
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,970
That still don't get us no closer...

1363
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:34,190
to which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though.

1364
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:37,650
- Does it Chris?
- No it sure don't.

1365
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:47,720
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy, to free Daisy.

1366
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,390
If I don't hear a confession from one of you

1367
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,800
motherfuckers quick, fast and in a hurry,

1368
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:58,310
I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy, down that bitches goddamn throat.

1369
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:02,790
Okay, time's up.

1370
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:08,810
Stop! Alright I did it, it was me I poisoned the coffy.

1371
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:12,090
I fucking knew it!

1372
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,040
You gonna' die now you murdering bastard.

1373
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:21,410
Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.

1374
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:24,610
You killed O.B. he's worth ten of you!

1375
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,550
Warren can I kill him?

1376
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:28,800
Say adios to your Huevos.

1377
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:39,500
Major Warren?

1378
01:58:56,350 --> 01:59:01,530
I ain't got no gun, sheriff.

1379
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:41,450
Chapter Five The Four Passengers.

1380
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:03,380
Earlier That Morning.

1381
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:57,800
Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?

1382
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,420
Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy.

1383
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:05,800
- How many ya' got?
- Full house today, friend.

1384
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:06,930
We got on in there waiting.

1385
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:09,380
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on waiting cause we ain't got no room.

1386
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,730
Well you need to tell Minnie. Cause he's been

1387
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,020
here two days and Minnie wants him outta here.

1388
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:16,420
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have.

1389
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:19,890
Listen why don't you take the passengers inside, introduce them to Minnie.

1390
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:22,530
- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.
- Okay.

1391
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,470
Here we are everybody, Minnie's Haberdashery.

1392
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:33,470
Step outside you and your friends can stretch

1393
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:35,370
your legs. When you're reday, stop on inside,

1394
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:40,370
get warm by the fire, get some coffy in you. I'll introduve you to Minnie.

1395
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,810
Hi Minnie!

1396
02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:06,180
I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business.

1397
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:09,210
But I would think coffy would be the first thing you'd make.

1398
02:03:09,330 --> 02:03:12,000
- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.
- Hats!

1399
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:15,330
Everybody, this is Minnie, and this is her place.

1400
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:18,350
Behind me plucking that chicken is Gemma.

1401
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:21,340
Lovley smile, that Gemma.

1402
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:23,680
Now the fella' in the uniform I don't know but

1403
02:03:23,690 --> 02:03:25,920
the one he's playing chess with is Sweet Dave.

1404
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:29,350
- Hi ya' Dave.
- Hey Judy.

1405
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:32,270
And Minnie, these are the passengers.

1406
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:34,810
Well that's not good enough.

1407
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:38,890
Go take away them rags, let's see some faces let's hear some names.

1408
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:41,780
Oswaldo Mobray, madame.

1409
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,320
Joe Gage.

1410
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,910
Bob.

1411
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:46,720
And I'm Jody.

1412
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:49,300
It's a pleasant surprise to find such a warm

1413
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:51,780
sanctuary in the middle of such a cold hell.

1414
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:55,660
Well make yourself comfortable. Get warm by the fire.

1415
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,760
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's by the stove, if that's all right?

1416
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,670
Stove, fireplace, whatever. Just get warm.

1417
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:04,960
Oh, and Judy said something about the best coffy in the world?

1418
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:09,280
Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world.

1419
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:12,440
Well I don't know 'bout all that. But I'll tell ya what it is.

1420
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,910
It's hot and it's strong and it's good. And

1421
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:17,380
in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up.

1422
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,850
You don't need to sell it, Minnie, you need make it.

1423
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:21,670
And you need to get your ass out there and

1424
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,550
help Charly with them bags and get Ed in here.

1425
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:28,110
- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.
- I'll fix you!

1426
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:31,560
I don't know some old man.

1427
02:04:31,570 --> 02:04:34,000
Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it.

1428
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:36,150
I'm just telling you what she said.

1429
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:40,670
Anyway she sent me out here to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.

1430
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:44,420
Got them, Ed.

1431
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:03,730
Miss Minnie? Would you roll me a cigarette?

1432
02:05:03,850 --> 02:05:07,480
Sure honey, I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?

1433
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,720
It's my favorite.

1434
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:17,930
Don't mind me gentlemen, I'm just watching.

1435
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,960
You play?

1436
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:25,300
You know, I must of had at least twelve people,

1437
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:32,120
teach me that goddamn game. Just never could keep the moves in my head.

1438
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:35,690
But if I'm not disturbing, I like to watch?

1439
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:39,150
Hell no. I like whipping this old man's ass in front of a audience,

1440
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:41,340
You ain't whipping shit.

1441
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:45,790
Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.

1442
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:50,250
- Oh that's real nice, what is that?
- It's french.

1443
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:53,250
- You speak french?
- Oui.

1444
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:57,220
- Oui, what is that mean?
- It means yes.

1445
02:05:57,340 --> 02:06:00,270
- Oui
- Yes.

1446
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:04,780
- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
- What?

1447
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:08,150
- Ask me if my ass is fat?
- It is.

1448
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:11,050
- I said ask me!
- Why?

1449
02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:14,910
- Just do it!
- Is your ass fat?

1450
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:19,470
Oui, look at that y'all I can speak French.

1451
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,620
Are you the jelly bean salesman around here?

1452
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:04,250
How many peppermint sticks I get for a nickel?

1453
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,100
Five.

1454
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:06,840
All right.

1455
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,750
- Here.
- Thank you sugar.

1456
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:14,710
Okay.

1457
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:25,360
Allow me to assist you, madame.

1458
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,370
I brought in your bags in case anybody wants

1459
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:50,360
to change your clothes before Red Rock.

1460
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:02,700
Peppermint stick?

1461
02:08:07,210 --> 02:08:08,870
Thanks.

1462
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:16,720
So why do they call you Six Horse Judy anyway?

1463
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:20,420
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team?

1464
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:25,440
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.

1465
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:35,870
- Could you holding this for me?
- Rock steady, madame. Rock steady.

1466
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:42,900
You gotta' very sweet accent, where that from, England?

1467
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:47,210
- I take exception to that!
- New Zeeland.

1468
02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:52,700
- Carefull, madame.
- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?

1469
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:16,970
Auckland, what the fuck is an Auckland?

1470
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:20,290
It's where I'm from, it's our biggest city.

1471
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:28,140
- Coffy's ready!
- It's about damn time.

1472
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:32,120
- Best coffy on the mountain.
- I'll don't know 'bout all that.

1473
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:36,630
Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers, not so much.

1474
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,960
Most find it a mite too strong.

1475
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:42,310
Can't be too strong on this mountain, thank you.

1476
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:51,200
Well, what'd ya' think?

1477
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,880
Shit!

1478
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:56,760
He adds something, not much, but something.

1479
02:10:57,130 --> 02:10:58,870
What do you think, Pete?

1480
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:07,410
Well I must admit, he does make the set up more convincing.

1481
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:17,780
Do we collect the bodies and chuck them in the well out there?

1482
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:21,250
And then start unhitching the horses and get them in the barn and get them fed.

1483
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:25,280
Well hang on, by puttin the horses away that's easy enough.

1484
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,860
To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.

1485
02:13:09,330 --> 02:13:12,510
Look I just started working here.

1486
02:13:12,630 --> 02:13:14,970
Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.

1487
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:17,930
I had nothing to do with it.

1488
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:33,650
Well old man,

1489
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:41,070
if you was a cat what just happened here

1490
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:45,340
would count as one of your nine lives.

1491
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,290
You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

1492
02:13:50,410 --> 02:13:55,790
Yes. And when it comes to that pile of niggers we building out back,

1493
02:13:55,910 --> 02:14:00,020
won't take nothing to make you General of it. You believe that?

1494
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:05,900
- I expect no less.
- Not so fast old man.

1495
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:10,510
You might have a way out of this yet.

1496
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:14,480
Later today,

1497
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:20,840
dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.

1498
02:14:25,210 --> 02:14:28,090
And he's gonna have my sister with him,

1499
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:32,420
and he's gonna have her in chains.

1500
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:38,730
He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.

1501
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:51,310
- You know why?
- No.

1502
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:59,350
Ten thousand dollars.

1503
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:01,750
That's why.

1504
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:05,070
And when he get's here.

1505
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:09,900
I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose.

1506
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:13,960
Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere

1507
02:15:13,970 --> 02:15:17,410
with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?

1508
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:19,420
- No.
- You don't.

1509
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:21,860
- No I don't.
- You sure you don't.

1510
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:26,210
I mean we did just kill Minnie and Sweet Dave.

1511
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:29,440
You and Sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here.

1512
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:31,600
I just met these people.

1513
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:34,770
I don't give a damn about them, or you, or your sister,

1514
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:39,100
or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter.

1515
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:43,510
That is a good answer, old man.

1516
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:46,520
So when they get here,

1517
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:52,270
you just sit your ass in this chair. And you don't do nothing.

1518
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:54,030
You don't say nothing.

1519
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:58,740
Hello, thank you, good night, that's about it.

1520
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:03,050
Maybe your name, but that's it.

1521
02:16:03,170 --> 02:16:08,160
Hello, thank you, good night and...

1522
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:10,740
- Maybe your name.
- Maybe my name.

1523
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:16,640
Be an old man, be dotty. Go to sleep.

1524
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:20,200
And don't you say nothing and I mean nothing

1525
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:23,590
to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.

1526
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:26,990
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1527
02:16:29,150 --> 02:16:35,980
When it's safe I kill him, free my sister and leave you be.

1528
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,420
Deal?

1529
02:16:43,790 --> 02:16:47,280
Deal, thank you.

1530
02:16:48,890 --> 02:16:55,430
During the next four hours, Jody and the boys chuck the bodies down the well.

1531
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:59,160
Put away the horses.

1532
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:03,390
Tidied around Minnie's.

1533
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:07,940
Stash weapons for further use.

1534
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:14,450
And waited for John Ruth and Daisy's Stage to arrive.

1535
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:16,960
Here they come.

1536
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:20,310
Okay boys, this is it.

1537
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:22,460
Let's get ready.

1538
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:32,170
Now remember, it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory,

1539
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,830
we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained

1540
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,510
to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly.

1541
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:40,980
Now killing that fella' 'fore he kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.

1542
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:44,270
But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1543
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:48,260
So the name of the game here is patience.

1544
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:52,530
Trapped here for two or three days, at some point, he will close his eyes

1545
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:55,490
and that's when you blow the top of his head off.

1546
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:58,010
Remember old man,

1547
02:17:58,010 --> 02:18:01,710
my sister don't make it off this mountain alive, neither do you.

1548
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:03,960
I'll do my best.

1549
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,820
Good luck, mate.

1550
02:18:34,660 --> 02:18:39,290
What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight?

1551
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:42,700
I can see you already got another one up in here.

1552
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:46,140
I just got through putting the horses away.

1553
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:47,770
This ain't the normal line.

1554
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:49,910
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,

1555
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:52,040
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

1556
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:53,450
I can do another one.

1557
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:55,750
And Sweet Dave inside?

1558
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:59,310
They ain't here. I'm running the place while they're gone.

1559
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:03,110
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

1560
02:19:03,230 --> 02:19:07,630
He says they ain't here. He's looking after the place while they gone.

1561
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:12,520
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob.

1562
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:18,710
Well whoever you are, help O.B. with the horses.

1563
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:26,800
Get them outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's them.

1564
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:35,220
I just put those other horses away. You need it done fast, you need to help.

1565
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:38,810
I got two of my best men on it.

1566
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:43,420
You heard him freeloaders, get to work.

1567
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:49,380
Come on let's go!

1568
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:53,150
- Open up!
- You have to kick it open!
- What?

1569
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:56,070
Kick it open!

1570
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:08,320
Last Chapter Black Man, White Hell.

1571
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:28,770
How you doing old boy?

1572
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,450
They shot my nuts off they're freezing

1573
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:38,300
burining up the same time, bleedin like a stuck pig.

1574
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:41,080
I think I'm gonna die.

1575
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:44,160
And these motherfuckers did it.

1576
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:49,900
That's how I'm doing. How you doing?

1577
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:53,610
Well my leg hurts really bad.

1578
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:56,850
But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot...

1579
02:20:56,970 --> 02:21:00,290
I'm just being sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg.

1580
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:06,580
Just make yourself comfortable.

1581
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:12,680
Don't worry about my comfort. Shit! I can't feel my ass no more.

1582
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:20,710
Worry about these owl hoots and that bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.

1583
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,950
All right!

1584
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:25,220
You!

1585
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:28,080
Fella' in the basement!

1586
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:34,290
You either give up by the time I count to three,

1587
02:21:34,410 --> 02:21:38,170
or I shoot Domergue in the head.

1588
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:41,430
One!... Two!...

1589
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:46,300
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot her! I'm coming up!

1590
02:21:46,420 --> 02:21:50,240
Hold on there you bushwhacker sack shooter, you

1591
02:21:50,250 --> 02:21:53,680
just open the door we tell you to come up!

1592
02:21:58,230 --> 02:22:01,050
Now throw out your pistol!

1593
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:04,130
Throw it to the bed.

1594
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:07,720
Well he got another.

1595
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:11,870
Now throw out your other pistol.

1596
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:13,270
I ain't got another pistol!

1597
02:22:13,390 --> 02:22:15,630
Well you better shit another pistol out your ass!

1598
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:17,670
Cause if you don't throw one up

1599
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:20,370
here in the next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!

1600
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:26,370
See? Told ya'.

1601
02:22:27,170 --> 02:22:28,920
Now...

1602
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,740
with your hands where we can see them...

1603
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:37,260
slowly come on up!

1604
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:11,040
How ya' doing dummy?

1605
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,380
Better. Now I see your ugly face.

1606
02:23:22,050 --> 02:23:25,340
How you like you that? You bushwhacker castrator!

1607
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:27,930
What are you doing he was giving up?

1608
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:30,410
It took him too long so I done for him.

1609
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:37,640
Joe Gage get your ass over and shut this trap door.

1610
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,550
I'm sorry, honey.

1611
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:09,980
May I sit in the chair?

1612
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:12,860
Yes you may.

1613
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:24,810
Keep your hands flat on that table.

1614
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,800
And don't move them.

1615
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,860
Mannix!

1616
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:32,280
You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover.

1617
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:33,440
Don't you see that nigger

1618
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,990
and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger?

1619
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:38,210
You're about to be murdered in some nigger named.

1620
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:40,110
Minnie's house and you don't even know why!

1621
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:44,140
Okay, bitch...

1622
02:24:44,510 --> 02:24:48,090
I'll bite... why?

1623
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:51,030
I am workin with all three of them fella's...

1624
02:24:51,150 --> 02:24:53,850
but not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me.

1625
02:24:53,970 --> 02:24:59,330
But because we're all gang members, The Jody Domergue Gang!

1626
02:24:59,450 --> 02:25:05,610
That fella' y'all just killed in the basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!

1627
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:10,380
Well who the hell, is Jody Domergue?

1628
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:13,830
You wanna tell them bounty man?

1629
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:17,840
He's a big bad cat. He's worth fifty thousand dollars.

1630
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:21,880
And every member of his gang is wort at least ten.

1631
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,250
Witch finally explains why you're worth ten.

1632
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:27,360
And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes

1633
02:25:27,370 --> 02:25:29,290
out nigger, so is my brother's fifteen men

1634
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:31,990
coming straight here for us! Tell them Grouch!

1635
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:35,640
Jody's got fifteen men waiting in Red Rock.

1636
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:39,910
If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here.

1637
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:47,240
Their job was to sack the town, kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.

1638
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:52,370
Now with brohter dead, I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?

1639
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:54,100
Oh yeah.

1640
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,740
And Chris I'm telling you,

1641
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:58,980
you ain't done anything yet, we can't forgive.

1642
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:00,480
So...

1643
02:26:00,490 --> 02:26:03,050
- let's make a deal?
- No deals, bitch!

1644
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:06,310
You gonna' let that nigger speak for you, Chris?

1645
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:07,440
Hold it Warren.

1646
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:13,530
Seeing as she ain't got nothing to sell, I'm

1647
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:17,630
kinda curious about her sales pitch, humor me.

1648
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,870
All right, bitch.

1649
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:36,680
What's... your... deal?

1650
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,270
Easy.

1651
02:26:38,390 --> 02:26:42,520
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.

1652
02:26:43,170 --> 02:26:47,030
Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days.

1653
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:48,580
When the snow melts...

1654
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:51,550
we go back to Mexico

1655
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:56,000
and you go on to Red Rock to get that star pinned on your chest.

1656
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:01,330
Well... we can give them Marco.

1657
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:05,120
Bob's real name is "Marco The Mexican".

1658
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:07,920
He's worth twelve thousand dollars.

1659
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:11,990
- That's "Marco The Mexican"?
- Precisely, yeah.

1660
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:18,190
Shit, after I blew his face off, Marco ain't worth a peso.

1661
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:25,370
If I die in the next two days,

1662
02:27:25,370 --> 02:27:28,840
which is more than likely, you can have me.

1663
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:32,390
Under the name "English Pete Hicox" I've gotta' federal

1664
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:35,290
bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head.

1665
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:40,920
And it's all your Chris.

1666
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,760
You keep talking, Pete.

1667
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:46,360
You gonna talk yourself to death.

1668
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:49,930
Joe Gage, who you be?

1669
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:54,140
- Grouch Douglass.
- You heard of him?

1670
02:27:54,260 --> 02:28:00,660
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass. He's worth ten, just like Daisy.

1671
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:03,220
Remind me,

1672
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:08,050
why we wouldn't just kill all y'all and cash in?

1673
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:10,310
Oh, you can kill us all.

1674
02:28:10,310 --> 02:28:12,310
But you'll never spend a cent of that bounty money

1675
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:14,900
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

1676
02:28:15,020 --> 02:28:16,990
Because when that snow melts, the rest of Jody's

1677
02:28:17,010 --> 02:28:18,910
gang, all fifteen of them, that were waiting,

1678
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:21,450
in Red Rock are coming here.

1679
02:28:21,570 --> 02:28:24,510
Now let, let's say you shoot us all...

1680
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:28,420
If you really want all that Domergue Gang bounty money,

1681
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:31,520
you still got to get all our corpses into Red Rock.

1682
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:35,990
And that ain't gonna' be so easy. Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team.

1683
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:38,900
And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team.

1684
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:43,740
So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into Red Rock.

1685
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:46,410
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,

1686
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:48,910
you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any

1687
02:28:48,910 --> 02:28:50,650
more then let's say one body per horse.

1688
02:28:50,770 --> 02:28:56,690
So that's you, leading a string of four horses into Red Rock,

1689
02:28:56,810 --> 02:29:00,320
and with all them horses, in that snow,

1690
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:03,300
and you all by your lonesome, you're gonna be a mite poky.

1691
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:05,740
And you gonna' run smack dab into The Domergue.

1692
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:07,730
Gang and again Grouch, how many is that?

1693
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:12,060
- Fifteen killer strong.
- And when those fifteen killers,

1694
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:14,270
come across you,

1695
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:16,500
in possession of all of our dead bodies, they

1696
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:18,540
ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger.

1697
02:29:18,660 --> 02:29:24,310
There gonna go back to Red Rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town.

1698
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:28,210
You really the Sheriff of Red Rock? You wanna save the town?

1699
02:29:28,330 --> 02:29:30,620
Then shoot that nigger dead!

1700
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:37,870
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?

1701
02:29:37,870 --> 02:29:40,230
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!

1702
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:43,460
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?

1703
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:46,820
The deal still stands, Chris.

1704
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:49,860
You ain't done we can't forgive.

1705
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:52,500
It's still all on that nigger.

1706
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:57,050
Shoot them dead, take my body

1707
02:29:57,170 --> 02:30:01,240
and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou.

1708
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:46,850
Mannix!

1709
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:50,220
Give me my pistol!

1710
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:55,030
Catch them here.

1711
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,560
Catch them here.

1712
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:15,110
So...

1713
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:20,250
you were saying... we sit here...

1714
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:22,890
all nice and friendly like...

1715
02:31:23,010 --> 02:31:24,780
for the next two days...

1716
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:26,390
then the snow melts,

1717
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:34,140
you leave here, meet up with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?

1718
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,860
Yeah.

1719
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:41,010
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

1720
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,410
Yeah.

1721
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:46,270
But Jody's worth fifty thousand, what 'bout his body?

1722
02:31:46,390 --> 02:31:54,390
You gonna make a deal with this diabolical bitch?

1723
02:31:56,500 --> 02:32:02,100
I'm not saying I'm gonna' make a deal with her, we're just talking. Calm down.

1724
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:06,130
So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand?

1725
02:32:06,250 --> 02:32:08,360
You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.

1726
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:12,730
We take Jody's body back with us he got children.

1727
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:21,390
So I kill, Warren... and we're all friends?

1728
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:24,660
Yeah.

1729
02:32:34,220 --> 02:32:36,940
No deal, tramp.

1730
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:41,470
Chris you're making the biggest mistake of your life!

1731
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:45,260
When our boys get here in a coupla' days, their gonna cut your nuts off!

1732
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:49,490
And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt.

1733
02:32:49,610 --> 02:32:53,430
Well I guess I should be plum scared right now, huh?

1734
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,620
If you had any brains, you would be.

1735
02:32:57,950 --> 02:32:59,580
You see...

1736
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:05,280
here's the problem Daisy.

1737
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:09,250
In order for me to be scared of your threats,

1738
02:33:09,370 --> 02:33:11,890
I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members

1739
02:33:11,890 --> 02:33:13,580
waiting it out in Red Rock.

1740
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:18,710
And boy, oh boy... I sure don't.

1741
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:23,450
What I belive is...

1742
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:29,290
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass whatever the fuck his name was...

1743
02:33:29,410 --> 02:33:32,870
poisoned the coffy...

1744
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:37,100
and you watched him do it.

1745
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:43,300
And you watched me pork up and didn't say shit...

1746
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:46,720
and I believe...

1747
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:49,930
you all what you've always been...

1748
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:54,320
a lying bitch, who will do anything...

1749
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:57,320
to cheat that rope waiting for her in Red Rock.

1750
02:33:57,330 --> 02:34:00,400
Including shitting out fifteen extra gang members,

1751
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:04,450
Whenever you needs be.

1752
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,910
And...

1753
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:19,020
I believe when it comes to what's left of The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang...

1754
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:22,870
I'm looking at them, right here right, right

1755
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:26,870
now. Dead on this on this motherfucking floor.

1756
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:28,470
Goddamn right.

1757
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:32,770
You're gonna' die on this mountain, Chris.

1758
02:34:32,890 --> 02:34:37,940
- My brother leds an army of men...
- Horse Shit!

1759
02:34:39,170 --> 02:34:41,450
My daddy led an army,

1760
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:45,820
he led a renegade amry, fighting a lost cause!

1761
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:49,510
My daddy held up to four hundred men together after the war

1762
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:53,970
with nothing but their respect in his command.

1763
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:59,390
Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers.

1764
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:02,190
I don't feel so good.

1765
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:05,230
Oh, shit.

1766
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:19,370
You still alive, white boy?

1767
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:28,030
Mannix?

1768
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:29,790
Fuck!

1769
02:35:29,850 --> 02:35:30,910
Hey, boy!

1770
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:39,990
Get up!

1771
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:49,130
Chris Mannix! Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!

1772
02:35:49,250 --> 02:35:50,770
Wake the fuck up!

1773
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:00,800
Wake up, white boy!

1774
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:24,920
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.

1775
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:41,150
Chris Mannix, I may have misjudged you.

1776
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:46,150
Now we've come to the part of the story...

1777
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:52,650
- where I blow your goddamn head off!
- No, no, no don't shoot her!

1778
02:36:52,770 --> 02:36:55,190
Why the hell not?

1779
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:59,400
John Ruth.

1780
02:37:03,950 --> 02:37:08,120
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.

1781
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:16,740
What's the last thing...

1782
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:20,130
that bastard did, 'fore he died?

1783
02:37:20,250 --> 02:37:22,340
Was save your life.

1784
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:25,180
We gonna' die, white boy.

1785
02:37:25,300 --> 02:37:28,670
We ain't got no say in that.

1786
02:37:29,810 --> 02:37:33,380
But there's one thing left we do have a say in.

1787
02:37:34,450 --> 02:37:37,930
And that how we kill this bitich.

1788
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:42,260
And I say, shootings to good for her...

1789
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:47,860
John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere, anytime along the way,

1790
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:52,670
but John Ruth was The Hangman...

1791
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:57,830
and when The Hangman catches ya', you don't die by no bullet.

1792
02:37:58,470 --> 02:38:00,590
When the The Hangman catches ya'...

1793
02:38:01,470 --> 02:38:03,210
you hang.

1794
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:07,520
"You only need to hang Mean Bastards."

1795
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:12,270
"But Mean Bastards, you need to hang".

1796
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:41,510
As my first and final act as the Sheriff of Red Rock,

1797
02:38:41,630 --> 02:38:44,110
I sentence you, Domergue,

1798
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:48,930
to hang by the neck until dead.

1799
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:06,730
Hang on, Daisy. I wanna watch.

1800
02:39:41,070 --> 02:39:44,050
Now that, was a nice dance.

1801
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:48,840
That sure was pretty.

1802
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:43,480
Hey...

1803
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:47,870
can I see that Lincoln Letter?

1804
02:41:30,130 --> 02:41:33,390
Dear Marquis...

1805
02:41:33,510 --> 02:41:37,040
I hope this letter finds you...

1806
02:41:37,160 --> 02:41:41,230
in good health and stat...

1807
02:41:41,350 --> 02:41:43,900
I'm doing fine...

1808
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:48,920
altough I wish there were more hours in the day...

1809
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:52,540
is just so much to do...

1810
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:57,380
time's changing slowly... but surely...

1811
02:41:57,500 --> 02:42:02,190
and it's men like you that will make a difference...

1812
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:06,440
your military success was a credit...

1813
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:11,760
not only to you... but your race as well...

1814
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:17,300
I'm very proud everytime I hear new of you...

1815
02:42:17,420 --> 02:42:24,610
we still have a long way to go, but hand in hand...

1816
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:28,230
I know we'll get there...

1817
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:33,690
I just want to let you know, you're in my thoughts...

1818
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:39,230
hopefully our paths will cross in the future...

1819
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:46,190
until then... I remain your friend...

1820
02:42:46,310 --> 02:42:49,520
ole' Mary Todd's calling...

1821
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:55,060
so I guess it must be time for bed...

1822
02:42:55,180 --> 02:43:01,720
respectfully... Abraham Lincoln.

1823
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:08,970
Ole' Mary Todd... That's a nice touch.

1824
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:13,600
Yeah... Thanks.
