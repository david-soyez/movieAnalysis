00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,164
Are you the guys from Washington?

4
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,072
You get many other visitors out here?

5
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,735
How long you been on-site?

6
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,210
Since this morning.

7
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,941
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

8
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,549
How come nobody spotted it before?

9
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,347
ltos really not that surprising.

10
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,948
This landscape's changing all the time.

11
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,887
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

12
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,051
l do not know.
ltos probably a weather balloon.

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,491
l do not think so.

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,620
You know, we do not have
the equipment for a job like this.

15
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,364
How long before
we can start craning it out?

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,362
l do not think you quite understand.

17
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,398
You guys are going to need
one   of a crane.

18
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,919
<i>Base, we are in.</i>

19
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,323
<i>What is this?</i>

20
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,769
<i>Careful.</i>

21
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,962
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

22
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,366
<i>What is it?</i>

23
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,035
<i>My  .</i>

24
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,807
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

25
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,975
<i>ltos 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

26
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:35,639
<i>l do not care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

27
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,576
Open it!

28
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,048
Quickly, before he...

29
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,903
lt has taken me a long time
to find this place.

30
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,172
You should be commended.

31
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,267
Help him up.

32
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,185
l think that you are
a man of great vision.

33
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,718
And, in this way, we are much alike.

34
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,256
l am nothing like you.

35
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,882
No, of course, but

36
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,520
what others see as superstition,
you and l know to be a science.

37
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,896
What you seek is just a legend.

38
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,526
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

39
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,725
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odings treasure room.

40
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,428
lt is not something one buries.

41
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,231
But l think it is close, yes?

42
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,306
l can not help you.

43
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,013
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

44
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:27,375
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

45
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,487
l have no need for them to die.

46
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,228
Yggdrasil.

47
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,508
Tree of the world.

48
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,471
Guardian of wisdom.

49
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,416
And fate, also.

50
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:33,044
<i>And the Führer digs for trinkets
in the desert.</i>

51
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,458
You have never seen this, have you?

52
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,521
ltos not for the eyes of ordinary men.

53
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,230
Exactly.

54
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,728
Give the order to open fire.

55
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,103
Fool!

56
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,038
You can not control the power you hold.

57
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,166
You will burn!

58
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,006
l already have.

59
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,426
<i>ofConnell, Michael.</i>

60
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,286
Kaminsky, Henry.

61
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,621
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

62
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,559
Rogers, Steven.

63
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,433
lt kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, ha?

64
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,098
Nope.

65
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,543
Rogers.

66
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,377
-What did your father die of?
-Mustard gas.

67
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,417
He was in the 107th lnfantry.
l was hoping l could be assigned...

68
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,220
-Your mother?
-She was a nurse in a TB ward.

69
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,418
Got hit. could not shake it.

70
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,025
-Sorry, son.
-Look, just give me a chance.

71
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,695
you would be ineligible
on your asthmom alone.

72
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,196
ls there anything you can do?

73
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,004
l'm doing it.

74
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,704
l'm saving your life.

75
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,215
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

76
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,218
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

77
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,616
<i>Every able-bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.</i>

78
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,223
<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

79
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

80
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,555
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

81
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,929
Who cares?

82
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,695
Play the movie already!

83
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,499
Hey, you want to show some respect?

84
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,967
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

85
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,134
<i>our brave boys are showing

<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

87
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,377
let us go! Get on with it!

88
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,045
Hey, just start the cartoon!

89
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,277
Hey, you want to shut up?

90
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,848
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we will face any threat,</i>

91
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,287
<i>no matter the size.</i>

92
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,504
You just do not know when to give up,
do you?

93
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,041
l can do this all day.

94
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,678
Hey!

95
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,252
Pick on someone your own size.

96
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,463
Sometimes l think
you like getting punched.

97
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,792
l had him on the ropes.

98
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,032
How many times is this?

99
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,397
you are from Paramus now?

100
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,402
You know it is illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

101
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,975
And seriously, Jersey?

102
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,211
You get your orders?

103
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,874
The 107th.

104
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,683
Sergeant James Barnes,

105
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,151
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

106
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,150
l should be going.

107
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,752
Come on, man.

108
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,432
My last night!
l got to get you cleaned up.

109
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,058
Why? Where are we going?

110
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,500
The future.

111
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,400
l do not see what the problem is.

112
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,105
you are about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

113
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,712
You know there is
three and a half million women here?

114
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,044
Well, l'd settle for just one.

115
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,485
Good thing l took care of that.

116
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,178
Hey, Bucky!

117
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,583
what did you tell her about me?

118
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,657
Only the good stuff.

Holy cow.

<i>l did say a few years, did not l?</i>

133
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,982
Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

134
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,592
Come on, soldier.

135
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,662
Come on. you are kind of
missing the point of a double date.

136
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,237
we are taking the girls dancing.

137
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,364
You go ahead. l'll catch up with you.

138
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,335
you are really going to do this again?

139

Well, it is a fair. l'm going to try my luck.

140
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,742
As who, Steve from Ohio?

141
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,181
they will catch you.
Or worse, they will actually take you.

142
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,182
Look, l know
you do not think l can do this.

143
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,652
This is not a back alley, Steve. ltos war.

144
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,718
-l know it is a war.
-Why are you so keen to fight?

145
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,655
-There are so many important jobs.
-What do you want me to do?

146
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,693
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

147
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,386
-Yes. Why not?
-l'm not going to sit in a factory, Bucky.

148

Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

149

l got no right to do any less than them.

150
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,930
that is what you do not understand.
This is not about me.

151
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,499
Right. because you got nothing to prove.

152
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,244
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

153
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,278
Yes, we are.

154

Or Paramus?

Five exams in five different cities.

178
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,029
That might not be the right file.

179
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,971
No, it is not the exams l'm interested in.

180
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,202
ltos the five tries.

181
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,408
But you did not answer my question.
Do you want to   Nazis?

182
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,374
ls this a test?

183
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,084
Yes.

184
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,819
l do not want to   anyone.

185
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,688
l do not like bullies.
l do not care where they are from.

186
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,694
Well, there are already

187
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,734
so many big men fighting this war.

188
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,800
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

189
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,640
l can offer you a chance.

190
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,908
Only a chance.

191
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,741
-l'll take it.
-Good.

192
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,781
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

193
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,116
Brooklyn.

194
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,758
Congratulations, soldier.

195
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,043
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

196
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,149
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

197
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,749
Forgive me if l seem overcautious.

198
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,455
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

199
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,624
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

200
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,300
With this artifact

201
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,301
l am certain of nothing.

202
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,971
l fear it may not work at all.

203
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,305
Twenty percent.

204
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,878
Forty.

205
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,916
Sixty.

206
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,620
Stabilizing at 70% .

207
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,455
l have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

208
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,573
What was that?

209
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,278
l must congratulate you, Arnim.

210
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,550
Your designs do not disappoint.

211
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,957
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

212
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,959
The exchange is stable.

213
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,999
Amazing!

214
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,692
The energy we have just collected

215
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,738
could power my designs.
All my designs.

216
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,706
This will change the war.

217
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,174
Dr. Zola,

218
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,516
this will change the world.

219
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,918
Ready, exercise!

220
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,785
Recruits, attention!

221
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,315
Gentlemen, l am Agent Carter.

222
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,287
l supervise all operations
for this division.

223
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,527
what is with the accent, Queen Victoria?

224
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,724
l thought l was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

225
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:03,959
what is your name, soldier?

226
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,064
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

227
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,866
Step forward, Hodge.

228
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,006
Put your right foot forward.

229
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,775
We going to wrassle?

230
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,980
because l got a few moves
l know you will like.

231
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,115
Agent Carter!

232
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,853
Colonel Phillips.

233
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,925
l can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. that is good!

234
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,921
Get your   up out of that dirt

235
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,757
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

236
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,297
Yes, sir!

237
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,933
General Patton has said

238
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:43,134
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

239
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,769
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

240
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,344
And because they are
going to get better.

241
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
Much better.

242
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,986
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

243
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,117
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

244
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,723
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

245
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,164
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

246
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,398
Rogers! Get off of there!

247
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,596
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

248
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,802
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

249
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,448
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

250
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:31,182
And they will personally escort
Adolf   to the gates of  .

251
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,650
Pick up the pace, ladies!

252
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,784
let us go, let us go! Double time!

253
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,928
Come on! Faster! Faster!

254
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,698
Move! Move!

255
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,037
Squad, halt!

256
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,935
That flag means
we are only at the halfway point.

257
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,076
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

258
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,873
Move, move!

259
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,645
Come on! Get up there!

260
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,612
lf that is all you got,
this army's in trouble!

261
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,277
Get up there, Hodge!

262
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,920
Come on! Get up there!

263
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,026
Nobody's got that flag in 1 7 years!

264
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,991
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

265
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,363
let us go! Get back into formation!

266
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,099
Rogers! l said fall in!

267
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,913
Thank you, sir.

268
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,928
Faster, ladies! Come on.

269
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,533
My grandmother has more life in her,
  rest her soul.

270
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:54,995
Move it!

271
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,234
you are not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

272
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,243
l'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

273
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,644
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

274
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,148
l let it slide. l thought, ''What the  .''

275
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,945
Maybe he had be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

276
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,076
l never thought you would pick him.

277
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,346
Up.

278
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,189
You stick a needle in that kithes arm,
it is going to go right through him.

279
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,761
-Come on, girls.
-Look at that.

280
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,094
he is making me cry.

281
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,757
l am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

282
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,461
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

283
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,662
All the groveling l had to do

284
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,931
in front of Senator
what is-His-Name's committees?

285
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,234
Brandt. Yes, l know.
l am well aware of your efforts.

286
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,572
Then throw me a  .
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

287
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,578
he is big, he is fast. He obeys orders.

288
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,113
-he is a soldier.
-He is a bully.

289
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,111
You do not win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

290
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,252
You win wars with guts.

291
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,552
Grenade!

292
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,395
Get away!

293
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,298
Get back!

294
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,133
lt was a   grenade.

295
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,235
All clear. Back in formation.

296
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,609
ls this a test?

297
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,513
he is still skinny.

298
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,724
-May l?
-Yeah.

299
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,365
cannot sleep?

300
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,834
l got the jitters, l guess.

301
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,703
Me, too.

302
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,033
Can l ask you a question?

303
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,509
Just one?

304
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,147
Why me?

305
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,983
l suppose that is
the only question that matters.

306
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,160
This is from Augsburg. My city.

307
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,888
So many people forget

308
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,466
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

309
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,602
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

310
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,606
They felt weak. They felt small.

311
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,437
And then   comes along
with the marching

312
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,535
and the big show and the flags.

313
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,874
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

314
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,282
And he says, ''You.''

315
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,983
He says, ''You will make us strong.''

316
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,384
Well, l am not interested.

317
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,159
So he sends the head of Hydra,

318
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,598
his research division.

319
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,527
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

320
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,236
Now,  is
a member of the inner circle.

321
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,634
And he is ambitious.

322
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:46,340
<i>He and   share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

323
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,104
  uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

324
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,978
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

325
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,476
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

326
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,112
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

327
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,451
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

328
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,356
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

329
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:07,956
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he can not resist.

330
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,562
<i> must become
that superior man.</i>

331
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,369
Did it make him stronger?

332
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,840
Yes.

333
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,181
But there were other effects.

334
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,780
The serum was not ready.

335
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,992
But more important, the man.

336
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,225
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

337
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,458
so good becomes great.

338
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,261
Bad becomes worse.

339
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,165
This is why you were chosen.

340
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,836
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

341
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,880
may lose respect for that power,

342
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,145
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

343
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,517
And knows

344
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,351
compassion.

345
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,289
Thanks. l think.

346
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,135
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

347
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,433
That you will stay who you are.

348
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,946
Not a perfect soldier,

349
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,303
but

350
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,784
a good man.

351
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,456
To the little guys.

352
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,526
No, no. Wait, wait. What l am doing?

353
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,755
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

354
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,863
All right. we will drink it after.

355
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,534
No, l do not have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? l drink it now.

356
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,919
ls there something in particular
you need?

357
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,593
l understand you found him.

358
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,059
See for yourself.

359
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,702
You disapprove.

360
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,440
l just do not see
why you need concern yourself.

361
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,280
l cannot imagine he will succeed.

362
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,516
Again.

363
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,917
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

364
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,623
lf we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

365
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,462
Shall l give the order?

366
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,471
lt has been given.

367
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,972
Good.

368
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,613
Dr. Zola!

369
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,215
What do you think?

370
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,992
A masterpiece.

371
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,999
l know this neighborhood.

372
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,902
l got beat up in that alley.

373
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,568
And that parking lot.

374
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,781
And behind that diner.

375
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,683
Did you have something against
running away?

376
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,856
You start running,
they will never let you stop.

377
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,017
You stand up, you push back.

378
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,423
They cannot say no forever, right?

379
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,686
l know a little of what that is like,
to have every door shut in your face.

380
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,967
l guess l just do not know
why you would want to join the Army

381
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,434
if you were a beautiful dame.

382
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,070
Or a... A woman.

383
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,569
An agent. Not a dame.

384
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,498
You are beautiful, but...

385
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,504
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

386
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,047
l think this is the longest conversation
l've had with one.

387
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,042
Women are not exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

388
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,750
You must have danced.

389
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,516
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

390
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,582
And the past few years, it just

391
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,560
did not seem to matter that much.
l figured l'd wait.

392
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,124
For what?

393
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,165
The right partner.

394
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,114
This way.

395
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,753
-What are we doing here?
-Follow me.

396
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,798
Wonderful weather this morning,
is not it?

397
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,135
Yes, but l always carry an umbrella.

398
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,288
Good morning.

399
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,161
Please, not now.

400
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,133
Are you ready?

401
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:29,772
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

402
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,114
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

403
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,814
Why exactly am l in Brooklyn?

404
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,788
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

405
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,019
Of course, if you would given me
the generators l requisitioned...

406
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,289
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

407
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,795
This is...

408
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,559
Fred Clemson, State Department.

409
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,133
lf this project of yours comes through,

410
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,863
we would like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

411
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,702
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

412
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,779
Comfortable?

413
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,017
ltos a little big.

414
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,919
You save me any of that schnapps?

415
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,797
Not as much as l should have. Sorry.

416
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,497
Next time.

417
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,696
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

418
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,034
-Levels at 100% .
-Good.

419
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,108
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

420
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,374
but we are ready as we will ever be.

421
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,404
Agent Carter?

422
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,778
do not you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

423
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,475
-Yes, of course. Sorry.
-Good.

424
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,696
<i>Do you hear me? ls this on?</i>

425
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

426
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,971
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

427
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,600
<i>but the first step</i>

428
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,999
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

429
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,405
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

430
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,281
<i>the subjectos major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

431
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,450
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

432
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,991
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

433
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,593
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vito-Rays.</i>

434
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,429
That was not so bad.

435
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,402
That was penicillin.

436
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,238
Serum infusion beginning in

437
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,635
five,

438
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,704
<i>four,</i>

439
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,139
three,

440
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,076
two,

441
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,511
one.

442
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,432
Now, Mr. Stark.

443
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,828
Steven? Can you hear me?

444
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,390
ltos probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

445
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,528
We will proceed.

446
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,070
that is 10% .

447
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,239
Twenty percent.

448
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,777
Thirty.

449
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,480
<i>that is 40%.</i>

450
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,980
Vital signs are normal.

451
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,214
that is 50% .

452
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,016
Sixty.

453
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,992
Seventy.

454
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,591
Steven!

455
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,137
-Steven!
-Shut it down!

456
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,498
Shut it down!

457
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,335
  the reactor, Mr. Stark!

458
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,135
Turn it off!   it!   the reactor!

459
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,542
No!

460
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,540
do not! l can do this!

461
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,514
Eighty.

462
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,214
Ninety.

463
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,595
that is 100% .

464
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,118
Mr. Stark?

465
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,897
Steven. Steven.

466
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,965
The son of a   did it.

467
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,774
-l did it.
-Yeah, yeah.

468
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,603
l think we did it.

469
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,906
You actually did it.

470
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,477
How do you feel?

471
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,913
Taller.

472
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,258
You look taller.

473
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,156
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

474
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,465
l can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

475
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,131
Congratulations, Doctor.

476
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,900
Thank you, sir.

477
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,619
Stop him!

478
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,248
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

479
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,981
Hey, this guy's been shot!

480
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,222
l had him!

481
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,529
Sorry!

482
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,755
l'm sorry!

483
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,891
No! No! Not my son!

484
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,301
-Stop it!
-do not hurt him!

485
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,566
Get back!

486
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,071
Let me go!

487
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,509
Let go of my son!

488
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,477
do not hurt him!

489
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,548
Wait, do not! do not!

490
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,348
No! do not!

491
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,399
Go get him! l can swim!

492
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,914
-Who the   are you?
-The first of many.

493
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,017
Cut off one head,

494
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,890
two more shall take its place.

495
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,194
Hail Hydra.

496
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,045
<i>The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.</i>

497
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,054
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

498
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,056
You serve at his pleasure.

499
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,025
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

500
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,619
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

501
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,392
l no longer reflect his image
of   perfection.

502
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,900
You think this is about appearances?

503
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:29,405
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

504
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,907
And we had learned
through local intelligence

505
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,069
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

506
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,079
<i>The Führer feels... How does he put it?</i>

507
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,412
''The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!''

508
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,930
Gentlemen,

509
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:59,992
you have come to see
the results of our work.

510
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,602
Let me show you.

511
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,936
  speaks of a 1 ,000-year  ,

512
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,944
but he can not feed his armies
for a month.

513
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:12,379
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

514
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,510
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

515
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,150
And l suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

516
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,691
Science. But l understand
your confusion.

517
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,960
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

518
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,328
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one  ,

519
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,869
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

520
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,065
all in a matter of hours.

521
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,705
Your enemies?

522
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,437
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

523
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,173
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

524
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,311
Quite simply, gentlemen,

525
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,744
l have harnessed the power of the gods.

526
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,849
Thank you, Schmidt.

527
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:55,926
For what?

528
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,624
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

529
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,129
Berlin is on this map!

530
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,590
So it is.

531
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,297
You will be punished for your insolence!

532
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,930
<i>You will be brought
before the Führer himself!</i>

533
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,118
Schmidt...

534
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,025
My apologies, Doctor,

535
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:34,086
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in  's shadow.

536
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,490
Hail Hydra.

537
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,996
Hail Hydra!

538
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,336
Hail Hydra!

539
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,579
Think you got enough?

540
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:04,254
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

541
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,523
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

542
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,561
He deserved more than this.

543
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,427
lf it could work only once,
he had be proud it was you.

544
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,243
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

545
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,169
Great. Why do not we start with how

546
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,443
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

547
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,040
What have we got here?

548
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,178
Speaking modestly, l'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

549
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,184
But l do not know what is inside this thing
or how it works.

550
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,125
we are not even close to this technology.

551
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,853
-Then who is?
-Hydra.

552
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,860
l'm sure you have been
reading our briefings.

553
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,388
l'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

554
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,694
Hydra is the   deep-science division.

555
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,397
ltos led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

556
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,699
Hydra is practically a cult.

557
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,399
They worship Schmidt.
They think he is invincible.

558
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,069
So, what are you going to do about it?

559
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,372
l spoke to the Presidid not this morning.

560
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,905
-As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
-Colonel?

561
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,315
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

562
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,716
You, too, Stark.

563
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,748
we are flying to London tonight.

564
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,154
Sir? lf you are going after Schmidt,
l want in.

565
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,427
you are an experiment.
you are going to Alamogordo.

566
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,086
The serum worked.

567
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,993
l asked for an army
and all l got was you.

568
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,192
You are not enough.

569
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,669
With all due respect to the Colonel,

570
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,137
l think we may be missing the point.

571
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,809
l've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

572
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,147
Paper.

573
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,811
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

574
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,748
since your picture hit the newsstands.

575
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,714
You do not take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

576
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,752
and hide him in a lab.

577
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:46,228
Son, do you want to serve your country

578
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,299
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

579
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,592
Sir, that is all l want.

580
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,604
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

581
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,937
l do not know if l can do this.

582
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:05,675
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets   Nazis.

583
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,607
you are an American hero.

584
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,012
ltos just not how l pictured getting there.

585
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,713
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

586
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:13,949
You play ball with us,

587
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,992
you will be leading your own platoon
in no time.

588
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,583
Take the shield.

589
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:19,987
Go.

590
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:25,995
<i>who is strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

591
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,001
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

592
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,802
But there is still a way all of us can fight.

593
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:36,573
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what is right, night and day?</i>

594
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,572
Series E Defense Bonds.

595
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,379
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

596
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,977
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?</i>

597
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,355
<i>Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?</i>

598
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,520
<i>From Hoboken to Spokane</i>

599
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:58,625
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

600
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,734
Cut. Guys, do not look at the camera.

601
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,867
<i>We cannot ignore there is a threat
and a war we must win</i>

602
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,776
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

603
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:16,342
<i>who will hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?</i>

604
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,120
<i>Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?</i>

605
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,418
<i>who will rise or fall
Give his all for America?</i>

606
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,828
<i>who is here to prove that we can?</i>

607
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:33,995
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

608
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,769
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

609
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:40,037
We cannot do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

610
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,339
that is where you come in.
Every bond you buy

611
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,674
will help protect someone you love.

612
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,648
-Turn around! he is right behind you!
-Keep our boys armed and ready,

613
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,480
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

614
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:59,090
<i>Stalwart and steady and true</i>

615
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,533

<i>who will give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?</i>

618
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:11,431
<i>who will give the Axis the sack

619
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,807
<i>Far as an eagle will soar</i>

620
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:18,541

<i>He knows what we are fighting for</i>

623
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,658
<i>We know it is no one

624
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,360

00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,257

<i>How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?</i>

630
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,352
<i>Okay.</i>

631
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,329
<i>l need a volunteer.</i>

632
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,627
l already volunteered!
How do you think l got here?

633
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,160
Bring back the girls!

634
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,506
<i>l think they only know the one song, but</i>

635
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,712
<i>l'll see what l can do.</i>

636
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,707
You do that, sweetheart.

637
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,843
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

638
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,285
<i>Come on, guys,
we are all on the same team here.</i>

639
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,649
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

640
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,366
Bring back the girls!

641
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,636
do not worry, pal. they will warm up to you.
do not worry.

642
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,384
Hello, Steve.

643
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:05,881
Hi.

644
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,152
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

645
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,454
Officially, l'm not here at all.

646
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,828
That was quite a performance.

647
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,198
Yeah.

648
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,060
l had to improvise a little bit.

649
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,903
The crowds l'm used to
are usually more

650
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,473
twelve.

651
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,507
l understand you are
''America's New Hope.''

652
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,169
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state l visit.

653
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,802
ls that Senator Brandt l hear?

654
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,507
At least he is got me doing this.

655
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,141
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

656
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,920
And these are your only two options?

657
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,586
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

658
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,919
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

659
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,824
What?

660
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,035
You know, for the longest time,
l dreamed about

661
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,938
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

662
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,776
serving my country.

663
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,613
l finally got everything l wanted

664
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,174
and l'm wearing tights.

665
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,294
They look like they have been through  .

666
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,323
These men more than most.

667
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:29,127
 sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

668
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,133
and less than 50 returned.

669
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,443
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

670
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,211
The rest were killed or captured.

671
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,007
The 107th?

672
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,084
What?

673
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,882
Come on.

674
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:44,954
Colonel Phillips.

675
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,886
Well, if it is not
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

676
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,252
what is your plan today?

677
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,585
l need the casualty list from Azzano.

678
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,990
You do not get to give me orders, son.

679
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:54,222
l just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

680
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,322
You and l are going to have a
conversation later that you will not enjoy.

681
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,528
-Please tell me if he is alive, sir. B-A-R...
-l can spell.

682
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:11,036
l have signed more of these condolence
letters today than l would care to count.

683
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,440
But the name does sound familiar.

684
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,074
l'm sorry.

685
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,723
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

686
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,355
Yes, it is called ''winning the war.''

687
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,385
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

688
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,225
they are 30 miles behind the lines

689
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,129
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

690
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,701
we would lose more men than we would save.

691
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:35,465
But l do not expect you to understand that
because you are a chorus girl.

692
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,140
l think l understand just fine.

693
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,303
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

694
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:45,843
lf l read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

695
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,348
Yes, sir. l do.

696
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:02,455
lf you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

697
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,567
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

698
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,069
lf that is what it takes.

699
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,265
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

700
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:12,341
You do not know that.

701
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,410
Even so, he is devising a strategy.
lf he detects...

702
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,309
By the time he is done that,
it could be too late.

703
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,438
Steve!

704
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:29,017
You told me you thought l was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

705
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,024
Every word.

706
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,752
Then you got to let me go.

707
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,165
l can do more than that.

708
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,539
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

709
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,303
where is my helmet?

710
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,808
Anyone seen Rogers?

711
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,716
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

712
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,808
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

713
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:56,977
ltos a factory of some kind.

714
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,317
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

715
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,117
Just get me as close as you can.

716
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,885
You two are going to be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

717
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:03,960
And you will not?

718
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,528
Where l'm going, if anybody yells at me,
l can just shoot them.

719
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,257
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

720
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,333
Well, let us hope it is good for something.

721
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,457
Agent Carter?

722
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,865
lf we are not in too much of a hurry,

723
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,496
l thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

724
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,576
Stark is the best civilian pilot
l've ever seen.

725
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,316
he is mad enough to brave this airspace.
we are lucky to have him.

726
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,848
So, are you two... Do you...

727
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,416
...fondue?

728
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,786
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you are ready

729
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,328
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

730
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,296
Are you sure this thing works?

731
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,664
ltos been tested more than you, pal.

732
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,332
Get back here!
we are taking you all the way in!

733
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,114
As soon as l'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the   out of here!

734
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,349
You cannot give me orders!

735
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,278
The   l cannot! l'm a Captain!

736
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:25,941
<i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i>

737
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,340
even with components of this size.

738
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,374
lncrease the output by 60%

739
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:35,310
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

740
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:40,152
But these prisoners,
l'm not sure they have the strength.

741
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:43,492
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

742
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,825
There are always more workers.

743
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:49,991
Not now!

744
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:07,179
You know, Fritz,

745
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,516
one of these days,
l'm going to have a stick of my own.

746
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:44,915
Fellas.

747
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:47,808
Who are you supposed to be?

748
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,445
l'm Captain America.

749
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:54,150
l beg your pardon?

750
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:59,386
What, are we taking everybody?

751
01:00:59,758 --> 01:01:01,316
l'm from Fresno, Ace.

752
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:04,256
ls there anybody else? l'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

753
01:01:04,596 --> 01:01:07,565
there is an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

754
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:08,758
All right.

755
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:10,892
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

756
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:13,197
Get out fast and give them  .

757
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:15,000
l'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else l find.

758
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:17,631
Wait. You know what you are doing?

759
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:20,575
Yeah. l've knocked out Adolf  
over 200 times.

760
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,333
You know how to use that thing?

761
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:52,310
Okay.

762
01:01:54,646 --> 01:01:56,113
What is happening?

763
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:06,390
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

764
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,826
<i>-That one. "Zündung."
-Zündung?</i>

765
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:11,729
Get this thing going, Dugan!

766
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,161
l did not know you spoke German.

767
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:16,462
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

768
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:17,535
did not ask for the resume.

769
01:02:30,315 --> 01:02:31,680
-On your left!
-Up top!

770
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:51,599
No, no! What are you doing?

771
01:02:52,704 --> 01:02:55,673
Our forces are outmatched.

772
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:23,028
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

773
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,632
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

774
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:07,712
Bucky?

775
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:09,814
Oh, my  .

776
01:04:14,953 --> 01:04:16,420
-ls that...
-ltos me.

777
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:18,485
-ltos Steve.
-Steve?

778
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,023
-Come on.
-Steve.

779
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:25,321
l thought you were dead.

780
01:04:26,264 --> 01:04:27,629
l thought you were smaller.

781
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,598
Come on.

782
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:41,841
-What happened to you?
-l joined the Army.

783
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:50,278
-Did it hurt?
-A little.

784
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:52,019
ls this permanent?

785
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,281
So far.

786
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:24,948
Captain America!

787
01:05:25,223 --> 01:05:26,850
How exciting!

788
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:30,361
l am a great fan of your films!

789
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:36,022
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

790
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:38,198
Not exactly an improvement,

791
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,602
but still, impressive.

792
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:45,876
you have got no idea.

793
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,038
have not l?

794
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,722
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

795
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,197
you see, l was his greatest success!

796
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:27,480
You do not have one of those, do you?

797
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:30,083
You are deluded, Captain.

798
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,416
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

799
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:35,925
but in reality, you are just afraid

800
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:39,656
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

801
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:44,162
Unlike you, l embrace it proudly.

802
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,428
Without fear!

803
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:48,001
Then how come you are running?

804
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:02,143
Come on, let us go. Up.

805
01:07:05,123 --> 01:07:07,455
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

806
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:12,292
What about me?

807
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,327
Where will l sit?

808
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:16,661
Not a scratch, Doctor.

809
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:18,301
Not a scratch.

810
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,530
let us go. One at a time.

811
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:25,202
-have got to be a rope or something!
-Just go! Get out of here!

812
01:08:25,303 --> 01:08:26,668
No! Not without you!

813
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:28,902
 .

814
01:08:50,094 --> 01:08:53,427
Senator Brandt, l regret to report that

815
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:58,332
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

816
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:00,563
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

817
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:04,631
As a result,
l must declare Captain Rogers

818
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,637
killed in action. Period.

819
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:13,412
The last surveillance flight is back.

820
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:17,821
No sign of activity.

821
01:09:18,623 --> 01:09:21,387
-Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

822
01:09:24,028 --> 01:09:25,154
l cannot touch Stark.

823
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:28,094
he is rich and he is the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

824
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,689
You are neither one.

825
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:32,269
With respect, sir,
l do not regret my actions.

826
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,031
And l do not think
Captain Rogers did, either.

827
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:36,936
What makes you think
l give a   about your opinions?

828
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,838
l took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

829
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:42,504
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

830
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:43,580
because you had a crush.

831
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:46,013
lt was not that. l had faith.

832
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:51,113
Well, l hope that is a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

833
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:54,955
What the  's going on out there?

834
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,665
Look who it is!

835
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,958
Some of these men
need medical attention.

836
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:10,966
-Medic, we got wounded.
-Right over here.

837
01:11:11,068 --> 01:11:13,628
l'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

838
01:11:15,072 --> 01:11:16,699
That will not be necessary.

839
01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:21,806
Yes, sir.

840
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:24,848
Faith, ha?

841
01:11:31,589 --> 01:11:32,851
you are late.

842
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:38,388
could not call my ride.

843
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:42,131
Hey!

844
01:11:42,433 --> 01:11:44,060
let us hear it for Captain America!

845
01:12:01,085 --> 01:12:04,384
<i>l am honored
to present this medal for valor</i>

846
01:12:04,522 --> 01:12:08,117
to my personal friend, Captain America!

847
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,388
Captain America!

848
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:15,966
Captain, that is your cue!

849
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,795
l thought he had be taller.

850
01:12:33,818 --> 01:12:36,878
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

851
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:39,115
And the sixth one was

852
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:44,617
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

853
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,295
l just got a quick look.

854
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,968
Well, nobody's perfect.

855
01:12:54,272 --> 01:12:56,638
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

856
01:12:57,108 --> 01:12:58,939
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

857
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:01,568
all the parts to another facility
that is not on this map.

858
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,306
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

859
01:13:03,414 --> 01:13:06,076
l want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

860
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:07,207
What about us?

861
01:13:07,318 --> 01:13:10,082
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidtos  .

862
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:12,155
What do you say, Rogers? ltos your map.

863
01:13:12,256 --> 01:13:15,851
-You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
-Yes, sir. l'll need a team.

864
01:13:16,294 --> 01:13:18,319
we are already putting together
the best men.

865
01:13:18,696 --> 01:13:21,494
With all due respect, sir, so am l.

866
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:24,232
So, let us get this straight.

867
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:26,326
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

868
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:29,300
Pretty much.

869
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:31,705
Sounds rather fun, actually.

870
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:34,378
l'm in.

871
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:48,355
we are in.

872
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,557
 , l'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

873
01:13:52,663 --> 01:13:53,652
what is that?

874
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:56,857
Open a tab.

875
01:14:00,738 --> 01:14:02,205
Well, that was easy.

876
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:05,007
-Another round.
-Where are they putting all this stuff?

877
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,207
See? l told you.

878
01:14:11,849 --> 01:14:13,817
they are all idiots.

879
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:15,715
How about you?

880
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,546
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

881
01:14:19,857 --> 01:14:20,983
 , no.

882
01:14:21,092 --> 01:14:25,552
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

883
01:14:26,764 --> 01:14:28,391
l'm following him.

884
01:14:31,936 --> 01:14:33,301
But you are keeping the outfit, right?

885
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:37,399
You know what?

886
01:14:38,576 --> 01:14:39,702
ltos kind of growing on me.

887
01:14:51,188 --> 01:14:52,587
-Captain.
-Agent Carter.

888
01:14:55,326 --> 01:14:56,293
madam.

889
01:14:56,394 --> 01:14:59,363
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

890
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:00,760
Sounds good.

891
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:08,165
l see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

892
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:09,606
You do not like music?

893
01:15:09,707 --> 01:15:11,072
l do, actually.

894
01:15:12,877 --> 01:15:16,335
l might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

895
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:18,011
Then what are we waiting for?

896
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:20,507
The right partner.

897
01:15:21,652 --> 01:15:22,949
0800, Captain.

898
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:26,453
Yes, madam. l'll be there.

899
01:15:26,824 --> 01:15:28,348
l'm invisible.

900
01:15:28,893 --> 01:15:31,953
l'm turning into you.
ltos like a horrible dream.

901
01:15:32,563 --> 01:15:35,623
do not take it so hard.
Maybe she is got a friend.

902
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:39,962
Emission signature is unusual.

903
01:15:40,504 --> 01:15:42,472
Alpha and beto ray neutral.

904
01:15:43,908 --> 01:15:46,308
Though l doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

905
01:15:48,012 --> 01:15:49,309
Seems harmless enough.

906
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:52,546
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

907
01:16:02,093 --> 01:16:03,390
Write that down.

908
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:08,058
Excuse me. l'm looking for Mr. Stark.

909
01:16:08,165 --> 01:16:10,224
he is in with Colonel Phillips.

910
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,837
Of course, you are welcome to wait.

911
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:26,580
l read about what you did.

912
01:16:26,951 --> 01:16:28,578
Oh, the... Yeah.

913
01:16:29,386 --> 01:16:30,910
Well, that is, you know.

914
01:16:32,556 --> 01:16:33,955
Just doing what needed to be done.

915
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:37,124
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

916
01:16:43,467 --> 01:16:45,435
Really, it is not a big deal.

917
01:16:46,337 --> 01:16:48,464
Tell that to their wives.

918
01:16:51,842 --> 01:16:53,434
l do not think they were all married.

919
01:16:53,644 --> 01:16:55,202
you are a hero.

920
01:16:55,312 --> 01:16:57,803
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

921
01:16:57,915 --> 01:17:01,214
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

922
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:05,354
And seeing as they are not here...

923
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:15,020
Captain!

924
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:17,760
we are ready for you,
if you are not otherwise occupied.

925
01:17:18,903 --> 01:17:20,370
Agent Carter, wait.

926
01:17:20,671 --> 01:17:22,798
Looks like finding a partner
was not that hard after all.

927
01:17:22,907 --> 01:17:24,499
Peggy, that is not
what you thought it was.

928
01:17:24,608 --> 01:17:27,202
l do not think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

929
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:31,140
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

930
01:17:31,415 --> 01:17:32,507
Well, what about you and Stark?

931
01:17:32,616 --> 01:17:35,084
How do l know you two
have not been fondue-ing?

932
01:17:40,024 --> 01:17:42,322
You still do not know
a   thing about women.

933
01:17:43,928 --> 01:17:45,919
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

934
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,828
-Really? l did not think...
-Nor should you, pal.

935
01:17:48,933 --> 01:17:50,924
The moment you think you know
what is going on in a womands head

936
01:17:51,035 --> 01:17:53,401
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

937
01:17:53,504 --> 01:17:56,166
Me, l concentrate on work,
which at the moment

938
01:17:56,273 --> 01:17:59,106
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

939
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:01,071
Carbon polymer.

940
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:04,111
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

941
01:18:04,215 --> 01:18:07,673
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

942
01:18:08,052 --> 01:18:10,782
l hear you are kind of attached.

943
01:18:10,888 --> 01:18:12,287
ltos handier than you might think.

944
01:18:12,389 --> 01:18:14,516
l took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

945
01:18:15,226 --> 01:18:16,250
This one's fun.

946
01:18:17,094 --> 01:18:19,619
She is been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

947
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,288
-What about this one?
-No, no, that is just a prototype.

948
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:23,525
-what is it made of?
-Vibranium.

949
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:27,263
ltos stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

950
01:18:27,905 --> 01:18:30,703
ltos completely vibration absorbent.

951
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,268
How come it is not standard issue?

952
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:35,709
that is the rarest metal on Earth.

953
01:18:35,813 --> 01:18:37,474
What you are holding there,
that is all we have got.

954
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,776
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

955
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:41,714
l'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

956
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:43,719
What do you think?

957
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:55,565
Yes, l think it works.

958
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:07,002
l had some ideas about the uniform.

959
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:08,768
Whatever you want, pal.

960
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,802
You are failing!

961
01:21:16,707 --> 01:21:19,972
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

962
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:22,011
yet we are continually delayed

963
01:21:22,112 --> 01:21:24,774
because you can not outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

964
01:21:24,882 --> 01:21:26,850
This is hardly my area of expertise.

965
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:30,647
l merely developed the weapons.
l can not fire them.

966
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:35,220
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

967
01:21:35,993 --> 01:21:36,982
Sir!

968
01:21:39,296 --> 01:21:40,320
<i>l'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i>

969
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:43,696
We fought to the last man.

970
01:21:47,004 --> 01:21:48,972
Evidently not.

971
01:22:01,185 --> 01:22:04,382
Remember when l made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney lsland?

972
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:06,115
Yeah, and l threw up?

973
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:08,925
This is not payback, is it?

974
01:22:09,026 --> 01:22:10,755
Now why would l do that?

975
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:13,591
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

976
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:17,224
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

977
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:19,234
Wherever he is going,
they must need him bad.

978
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:28,709
let us get going,
because they are moving like the devil.

979
01:22:29,346 --> 01:22:31,041
We only got about a 10-second window.

980
01:22:31,148 --> 01:22:33,708
You miss that window,
we are bugs on a windshield.

981
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:35,318
Mind the gap.

982
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:37,284
Better get moving, bugs!

983
01:23:45,122 --> 01:23:47,215
Stop him! Fire again!

984
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:42,403
-l had him on the ropes.
-l know you did.

985
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,104
Get down!

986
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,681
Fire again!

987
01:24:48,452 --> 01:24:49,976
<i>  him! Now!</i>

988
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,227
Bucky!

989
01:25:02,332 --> 01:25:03,765
Hang on!

990
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:06,469
Grab my hand!

991
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,366
Sit down.

992
01:26:19,843 --> 01:26:22,141
-What is this?
-Steak.

993
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,206
What is in it?

994
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:26,645
Cow.

995
01:26:29,753 --> 01:26:32,745
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

996
01:26:32,856 --> 01:26:35,654
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

997
01:26:37,094 --> 01:26:38,493
l do not eat meat.

998
01:26:39,429 --> 01:26:40,555
Why not?

999
01:26:40,664 --> 01:26:42,325
lt disagrees with me.

1000
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:45,333
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1001
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:51,434
Every Hydra agent that
we have tried to take alive

1002
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:56,342
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1003
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,178
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1004
01:27:02,452 --> 01:27:03,749
You want to live.

1005
01:27:05,122 --> 01:27:07,249
you are trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1006
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,483
l bought you dinner.

1007
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:17,791
''Given the valuable information
he has provided

1008
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:22,129
''and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1009
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:25,439
''Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland''?

1010
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:29,501
l sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1011
01:27:30,213 --> 01:27:33,808
You guys have not broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1012
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:35,885
 will know this is a lie.

1013
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:39,547
he is going to   you anyway, Doc.
you are a liability.

1014
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,958
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1015
01:27:42,325 --> 01:27:47,456
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1016
01:27:47,564 --> 01:27:50,499
so l would not count on
the very best of protection.

1017
01:27:51,268 --> 01:27:53,896
ltos you or Schmidt.

1018
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:56,563
ltos just the hand you have been dealt.

1019
01:27:59,176 --> 01:28:02,270
 believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1020
01:28:04,014 --> 01:28:06,812
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1021
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:09,112
You do realize that is nuts, do not you?

1022
01:28:09,219 --> 01:28:10,186
What?

1023
01:28:11,221 --> 01:28:13,416
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1024
01:28:13,523 --> 01:28:15,650
-And why is that?
-Because he can do it!

1025
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:17,656
what is his target?

1026
01:28:18,962 --> 01:28:21,294
His target

1027
01:28:22,866 --> 01:28:23,924
is everywhere.

1028
01:28:44,754 --> 01:28:46,381
Tomorrow,

1029
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:50,456
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1030
01:28:51,228 --> 01:28:53,696
<i>borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.</i>

1031
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:58,767
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1032
01:28:59,402 --> 01:29:04,362
lf they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1033
01:29:08,879 --> 01:29:11,245
lf they cut off one head,

1034
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:14,545
two more shall take its place.

1035
01:29:14,918 --> 01:29:16,215
Hail Hydra.

1036
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:17,486
-Hail Hydra!
-Hail Hydra!

1037
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:20,816
-Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
-Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1038
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:35,600
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1039
01:29:35,972 --> 01:29:37,940
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1040
01:29:38,308 --> 01:29:43,268
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1041
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:47,040
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1042
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:57,026
Dr. Erskine said that

1043
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,862
the serum would not
just affect my muscles,

1044
01:29:59,963 --> 01:30:02,022
it would affect my cells.

1045
01:30:03,066 --> 01:30:06,866
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1046
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,597
Which means

1047
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:12,534
l cannot get  .

1048
01:30:14,344 --> 01:30:15,641
Did you know that?

1049
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,311
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1050
01:30:22,052 --> 01:30:24,680
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1051
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:31,661
lt was not your fault.

1052
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:34,456
-Did you read the report?
-Yes.

1053
01:30:35,665 --> 01:30:36,962
Then you know that is not true.

1054
01:30:37,067 --> 01:30:38,796
You did everything you could.

1055
01:30:42,205 --> 01:30:44,332
Did you believe in your friend?

1056
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:45,908
Did you respect him?

1057
01:30:47,544 --> 01:30:49,444
Then stop blaming yourself.

1058
01:30:49,813 --> 01:30:52,145
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1059
01:30:52,549 --> 01:30:54,039
He   well must have thought
you were worth it.

1060
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:58,177
l'm going after Schmidt.

1061
01:30:59,823 --> 01:31:03,122
l'm not going to stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1062
01:31:05,061 --> 01:31:06,688
You will not be alone.

1063
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:12,495
Johann  belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he is a  ,

1064
01:31:12,602 --> 01:31:14,536
and he is willing to   up
half the world to prove it,

1065
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:16,195
starting with the USA.

1066
01:31:16,306 --> 01:31:19,400
Schmidtos working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1067
01:31:19,509 --> 01:31:21,238
He gets across the Atlantic,

1068
01:31:21,344 --> 01:31:23,744
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1069
01:31:28,218 --> 01:31:29,810
How much time we got?

1070
01:31:29,919 --> 01:31:32,183
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1071
01:31:32,288 --> 01:31:35,257
-Where is he now?
-Hydra's last base is here.

1072
01:31:36,126 --> 01:31:39,527
ln the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1073
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:42,963
So what are we supposed to do?

1074
01:31:43,066 --> 01:31:45,626
l mean, it is not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1075
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:47,599
Why not?

1076
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:54,870
that is exactly what we are going to do.

1077
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:04,599
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1078
01:34:04,707 --> 01:34:06,800
but l must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1079
01:34:09,746 --> 01:34:12,374
But there are limits

1080
01:34:12,749 --> 01:34:15,013
to what even you can do, Captain.

1081
01:34:15,518 --> 01:34:18,749
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1082
01:34:18,855 --> 01:34:20,288
He told me you were insane.

1083
01:34:25,028 --> 01:34:26,996
He resented my genius

1084
01:34:27,096 --> 01:34:30,657
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1085
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:32,325
But he gave you everything.

1086
01:34:34,771 --> 01:34:35,999
So,

1087
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:40,367
what made you so special?

1088
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:44,706
Nothing.

1089
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:47,439
l'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1090
01:34:58,995 --> 01:35:00,553
l can do this all day.

1091
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:02,654
Of course you can, of course.

1092
01:35:02,765 --> 01:35:06,064
But, unfortunately,
l am on a tight schedule.

1093
01:35:11,774 --> 01:35:13,139
So am l.

1094
01:35:25,622 --> 01:35:28,250
Rogers! You might need this!

1095
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:29,692
Thanks!

1096
01:35:40,937 --> 01:35:43,428
we are in! Assault team, go!

1097
01:35:43,673 --> 01:35:44,970
Move out!

1098
01:35:45,908 --> 01:35:47,637
Move!

1099
01:35:53,549 --> 01:35:55,574
Keep your spacing!

1100
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:37,352
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1101
01:36:38,895 --> 01:36:40,556
let us go find two more!

1102
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:08,257
you are late.

1103
01:37:11,294 --> 01:37:13,262
-were not you about to...
-Right.

1104
01:38:27,937 --> 01:38:28,926
Get in!

1105
01:38:57,633 --> 01:38:58,930
-Keep it steady!
-Wait!

1106
01:39:04,507 --> 01:39:05,701
Go get him.

1107
01:39:07,677 --> 01:39:09,338
l'm not kissing you!

1108
01:42:48,831 --> 01:42:51,959
-You do not give up, do you?
-Nope!

1109
01:44:00,836 --> 01:44:03,396
You could have the power of the gods!

1110
01:44:04,106 --> 01:44:08,736
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1111
01:44:09,645 --> 01:44:11,772
l have seen the future, Captain!

1112
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:15,774
-There are no flags!
-Not my future!

1113
01:44:29,665 --> 01:44:30,689
What have you done?

1114
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:32,634
No!

1115
01:45:40,936 --> 01:45:42,995
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1116
01:45:43,272 --> 01:45:44,432
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1117
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,939
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1118
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:47,531
<i>Peggy, Schmidtos dead!</i>

1119
01:45:48,244 --> 01:45:49,768
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1120
01:45:51,647 --> 01:45:53,114
that is a little bit tougher to explain.

1121
01:45:53,582 --> 01:45:55,948
Give me your coordinates.
l'll find you a safe landing site.

1122
01:45:57,253 --> 01:45:59,346
there is not going to be a safe landing.

1123
01:45:59,622 --> 01:46:01,214
<i>But l can try and force it down.</i>

1124
01:46:01,323 --> 01:46:03,291
l'll get Howard on the line.
he shall know what to do.

1125
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,381
<i>there is not enough time.</i>

1126
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:07,087
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it is heading for New York.</i>

1127
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,463
l got to put her in the water.

1128
01:46:13,936 --> 01:46:16,632
Please, do not do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1129
01:46:16,939 --> 01:46:18,065
Right now l'm in the middle of nowhere.

1130
01:46:18,173 --> 01:46:20,573
lf l wait any longer,
a lot of people are going to die.

1131
01:46:26,115 --> 01:46:27,309
Peggy,

1132
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:30,380
this is my choice.

1133
01:46:54,643 --> 01:46:55,769
Peggy?

1134
01:46:56,645 --> 01:46:57,942
<i>l'm here.</i>

1135
01:47:00,816 --> 01:47:03,614
l'm going to need a rain check
on that dance.

1136
01:47:11,827 --> 01:47:12,953
All right.

1137
01:47:15,998 --> 01:47:18,364
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1138
01:47:19,835 --> 01:47:21,132
You got it.

1139
01:47:23,072 --> 01:47:27,031
<i>8:00 on the dot.
do not you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1140
01:47:29,411 --> 01:47:31,470
You know,
l still do not know how to dance.

1141
01:47:37,686 --> 01:47:40,655
l'll show you how. Just be there.

1142
01:47:42,024 --> 01:47:43,651
we will have the band
play something slow.

1143
01:47:47,763 --> 01:47:49,321
<i>l'd hate to step on your...</i>

1144
01:47:52,368 --> 01:47:53,335
Steve?

1145
01:47:55,871 --> 01:47:57,168
Steve?

1146
01:48:00,542 --> 01:48:01,736
Steve?

1147
01:49:00,803 --> 01:49:02,270
To the Captain.

1148
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:15,417
Sir?

1149
01:49:25,561 --> 01:49:27,529
Take us to the next grid point.

1150
01:49:27,796 --> 01:49:29,855
But there is no trace of wreckage.

1151
01:49:30,566 --> 01:49:33,194
And the energy signature stops here.

1152
01:49:34,303 --> 01:49:36,032
Just keep looking.

1153
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,165
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1154
01:50:48,477 --> 01:50:51,173
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1155
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,446
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1156
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:57,417
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1157
01:50:58,887 --> 01:51:02,015
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1158
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:06,054
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1159
01:51:06,895 --> 01:51:09,193
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1160
01:51:13,735 --> 01:51:16,533
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1161
01:51:16,672 --> 01:51:19,800
<i>would not the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1162
01:51:20,242 --> 01:51:22,369
<i>Pete leans in. here is the pitch.</i>

1163
01:51:22,744 --> 01:51:25,804
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1164
01:51:27,749 --> 01:51:29,046
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1165
01:51:29,418 --> 01:51:32,876
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1166
01:51:33,922 --> 01:51:36,220
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they will not get him.</i>

1167
01:51:37,693 --> 01:51:38,660
Good morning.

1168
01:51:40,696 --> 01:51:42,391
Or should l say afternoon?

1169
01:51:43,532 --> 01:51:44,556
Where am l?

1170
01:51:45,367 --> 01:51:47,358
you are in a recovery room
in New York City.

1171
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:52,729
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1172
01:51:53,108 --> 01:51:54,905
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1173
01:51:55,277 --> 01:51:58,610
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1174
01:51:58,714 --> 01:51:59,942
Where am l really?

1175
01:52:01,283 --> 01:52:03,251
l'm afraid l do not understand.

1176
01:52:04,052 --> 01:52:05,349
The game.

1177
01:52:05,554 --> 01:52:08,421
ltos from May 1941 .
l know, because l was there.

1178
01:52:12,461 --> 01:52:14,429
Now, l'm going to ask you again.

1179
01:52:14,997 --> 01:52:15,964
Where am l?

1180
01:52:17,332 --> 01:52:18,629
-Captain Rogers...
-Who are you?

1181
01:52:26,275 --> 01:52:27,902
Captain Rogers, wait!

1182
01:52:29,745 --> 01:52:31,440
All agents, code 13!

1183
01:52:31,947 --> 01:52:34,780
<i>l repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1184
01:52:55,437 --> 01:52:56,961
At ease, soldier!

1185
01:53:05,547 --> 01:53:08,448
Look, l'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1186
01:53:09,785 --> 01:53:12,754
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1187
01:53:12,954 --> 01:53:14,251
Break what?

1188
01:53:16,692 --> 01:53:18,319
you have been asleep, Cap.

1189
01:53:18,827 --> 01:53:20,852
For almost 70 years.

1190
01:53:35,477 --> 01:53:36,671
You going to be okay?

1191
01:53:37,813 --> 01:53:38,837
Yeah.

1192
01:53:39,214 --> 01:53:40,511
Yeah, l just...

1193
01:53:43,952 --> 01:53:45,442
l had a date.

1194
02:03:07,115 --> 02:03:08,742
Trouble sleeping?

1195
02:03:11,619 --> 02:03:12,916
you are here with a mission, sir?

1196
02:03:13,888 --> 02:03:14,877
l am.

1197
02:03:15,623 --> 02:03:17,420
Trying to get me back in the world?

1198
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:19,888
Trying to save it.

1199
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:30,733
<i>You think you are the only hero
in the world?</i>

1200
02:03:44,986 --> 02:03:46,112
Gentlemen?

1201
02:03:46,921 --> 02:03:47,979
you are up.

1202
02:03:53,962 --> 02:03:54,929
Got a mean swing.
