I could ever truly escape him

would be to disappear completely.

I don't fit into any one faction.

who's in power then?

And we're not a threat to Candor.

539

That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.

540

is you're both wanted

542
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,283
in the attack on Abnegation.

543
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,606
Those are lies.

544

If you were Candor,
I would take you at your word.

545
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,804

546

over to the Council.

You might as well just kill us now.

we're not gonna live to stand trial.

I doubt that very much.

551

She would never supersede the Council.

Who's gonna stop her? You?

(GRUNTS)

557
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,325
Can I ask you one question?

558
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,924
Jeanine believes that Erudite
are most fit to govern

559
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,809
because they are the smartest.

560
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,960
Do you believe that Candor is most fit
to judge because you're so honest?

561
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,731
I admit I do hold that belief.

562
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,923
Then would you say that
a trial held here at Candor

563
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,320
would be inherently more fair
than a trial held by Erudite?

564
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,841
Hmm.

565
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,685
The answer is yes.

566
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,444
In my opinion, a Candor trial would have

567
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,688
the greatest chance of
achieving true justice.

568
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,844
So are you asking me to
petition the Council

569
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,649
to grant Candor sole judiciary power?

570
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,529
No. As part of Candor's initiation,

571
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,011
you administer a truth serum.

572
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,887
Correct?

573
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,360
We don't typically discuss
such matters out of faction.

574
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,686
That's a pretty evasive answer.

575
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,000
Evasion is not dishonest.

576
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,122
It's not exactly honesty either.

577
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,085
Yes. We possess such a serum.

578
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,566
Then use it on us.

580
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,363

But you should know
that the serum can be quite brutal.

who are already predisposed to honesty.

00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,924

Is this true?

Conspiring, no.

00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,967
But I did attack.

599
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,928
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine

600

and the rest of the Dauntless
that she recruited.

601
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,045
Tris found me.

602
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,088
She managed to break me free
from the simulation,

603
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,650
and then together we...

604
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,808
Together we fought our way out.

that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?

Yes.
