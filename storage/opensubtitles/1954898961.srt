717
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:55,062

Whatever they did to him,
we need to reverse it.

01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,213
We need to get him back!

1075

He's not even human.
We don't know what the hell he is.

I do.

1077
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,387
At the end of the war,
Skynet was trying to develop

1078
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,464
a new type of infiltration unit

1079
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:46,590
by infecting human subjects
with machine-phase matter.

1080
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,498
It restructures and rebuilds
human tissue on a cellular level

1081
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,661
for maximum combat utility.

1082
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,137
Skynet's made John into a terminator.

But the experiments failed.

1087
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,385
The human subjects
went insane and died.

1088
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,921
Yeah, well, John's got
the crazy part down.

1089
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,918
Does he have any weaknesses?

1090

Matter coheres using a magnetic field.

1091
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,858
Disrupting that field may trap him.

1092
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,496
Right, but if he can be cured...

1093
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,830
Negative. His body
was replaced on a cellular level.

1094
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,301
There is no cure.

1095
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,133

SARAH: Reese...

1096
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,798
No, I'm not going to let
a machine tell me what's possible!

1097
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,841
You said all the other
subjects died, right?

1098
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,966
Well, that means John's one-of-a-kind.
He's unique!

1099
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,639
All right? There's no way of knowing
what he's capable of.

1100
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:36,343
You're right, and that's what
makes him so dangerous!

1116
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,980
You were a good investment.

I appreciate it.

- Huh?
- Phew!
