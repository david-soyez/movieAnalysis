2
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,382
Minions.

3
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,923
<i>Minions have
been on this planet
far longer than we have.</i>

4
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,895
<i>They go by many names.
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.</i>

5
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,895
<i>Oh, that one is Norbert.</i>

6
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,301
<i>He's an idiot.</i>

7
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,462
<i>They're ail different,
but may as
share the same goat.</i>

8
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,734
<i>To serve the most
despicable master
they could find.</i>

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
Boss!

10
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,741
<i>Making their master happy
was the tribes very
reason for existence.</i>

11
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,950
<i>But that's not to say
that they didn't
have other passions.</i>

12
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,254
Huh?

13
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,434
<i>Finding a boss was easy.</i>

14
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,928
<i>But keeping a boss,
therein lies the rub.</i>

15
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,249
<i>Nope,
it wasn't easy
for these guys.</i>

16
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,976
<i>But may never gave up.</i>

17
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,548
<i>With the emergence
of the Stone Age</i>

18
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,886
<i>came the rise of a new species.</i>

19
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,687
<i>Man was very different
from the dinosaur.</i>

20
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,319
<i>He was shorter, hairier.</i>

21
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,058
<i>And way, way smarter.</i>

22
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,332
<i>The Minions took
an instant liking to man,</i>

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,272
<i>and helped him
the best they could.</i>

24
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,735
Oh, no, no.

25
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,509
Eh?

26
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,728
<i> Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile.</i>

27
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,357
<i>So, so delicious!</i>

28
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,260
<i>Their quest for a boss
put the Minions
front and center</i>

29
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,703
<i>for some of civilization's
most historic moments.</i>

30
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,871
Anubis!

31
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,107
<i>Ancient Egypt
held great promise.</i>

32
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,577
Okay!  Pancake!

33
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,584
<i>But it didn't last long.</i>

34
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,122
Hmm. Oh!

35
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,283
Ow!

36
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,630
<i>The Dark Ages were
actualiy fun times.</i>

37
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,332
<i>Their new master had a tendency</i>

38
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,336
<i>to party all nigh!
And sleep all day.</i>

39
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,105
Ooh!

40
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,343
Oh.

41
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,684
<i>But eventually,
the party was over.</i>

42
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,120
<i>They bounced from
one evil boss to another,</i>

43
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,598
<i>but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.</i>

44
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,970
<i>One particular employer
took their failure very,
very badly.</i>

45
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,115
Huh?

46
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,545
<i>The Minions
had no other choice
but to keep moving.</i>

47
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,157
Oh.

48
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,719
<i>And then,
when all hope seemed lost,</i>

49
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,623
<i>they found sanctuary.</i>

50
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,624
<i>The Minions were safe!</i>

51
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,698
<i> Years passed
as the Minions forged
their own civilization.</i>

52
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>They truly made
a life for themselves.</i>

53
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,070
<i>But something
just wasn't right.</i>

54
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,074
<i>They fen empty inside.</i>

55
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,410
<i>Without a master,
they had no purpose.</i>

56
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,247
<i>They became aimless
and depressed.</i>

57
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,060
<i>If this continued
any longer,
the Minions would perish.</i>

58
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,930
<i>But all was not lost
for one Minion had a plan.</i>

59
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,062
<i>His name was Kevin.</i>

60
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,109
<i>He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.</i>

61
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,046
<i>He'd been preparing
for days, weeks, months.</i>

62
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,748
<i>But now he was ready.</i>

63
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,388
Buddies!

64
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,907
<i>Kevin would leave
the cave...</i>

65
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,639
<i>...go back
to the outside world,</i>

66
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,112
<i>and he would not return
until he had found his tribe</i>

67
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,514
<i>the biggest,
baddest villain to serve.</i>

68
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,309
<i>But he needed help.</i>

69
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,512
Me!

70
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,651
<i>Bob was eager in go,</i>

71
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,987
<i>but Kevin Yeti he was
just not strong enough</i>

72
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,993
<i>for the dangerous
journey ahead.</i>

73
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,086
Uh, no.

74
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,337
<i>Luckily, someone stepped up.</i>

75
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,372
Stuart!

76
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,770
Huh? Me, me?
Oh! Thank you.

77
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,837
<i>Truth be mid,
Stuart had no idea
what he was chosen for...</i>

78
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,616
<i>...but was thrilled
it made people
cheer for him.</i>

79
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,279
Thank you.

80
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,793
Me!

81
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,696
Eh, okay.

82
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,047
<i>Eventually,
Bob's energy and enthusiasm,</i>

83
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,847
<i>but mostly Sack of
other volunteers,
changed Kevin's mind.</i>

84
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,650
<i>The tribe said their farewells.</i>

85
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,187
<i>Kevin had given them
something they hadn't had
in a very long time.</i>

86
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,528
<i>Hope.</i>

87
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,726
Bob!

88
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,871
Hey, Tony!

89
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,596

00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,572
Chris...

91
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,007
Hey, Bob.

92
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,205
Oh.

93
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,207
Bye-bye.

94
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,252
<i>Kevin felt pride.</i>

95
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,918
<i>He was going to be
the one to save his tribe.</i>

96
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,922
<i>Stuart felt hungry mostly.</i>

97
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,695
<i>He was going to be {he one
to eat this banana.</i>

98
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,067
<i>And Bob...</i>

99
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,371
<i>Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.</i>

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,738
Ah. Okay.

101
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,144
Okay. Okay.

102
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,984
And they were off.

103
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,394
<i>Off to find their new boss!</i>

104
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,177
Huh? Kevin!

105
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,170
Huh?

106
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,980
Huh? Banana!

107
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,774

Glad we came along

Oh, you, too!

Okay.

242
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:13,984
Heck, yeah!

243
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,819
Thanks, man!

244
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,253
All righty! Who needs
to stretch their legs?

245
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,764
Yeah!
Yes! Me, me, me!

Sweet!
You guys wait here,
we'll be right back.

247

Okay, Nelsons, let's do this!

- Okey-dokey.
- On the road again.

250
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,059
Dad! We got company!

251
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,225
It's because I tripped
the alarm. I stink!

252
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,861
Hey, we all
make mistakes, sugarplum.
You're still learning.

253
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,631
Huh! What?

254
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,969
- Your father's right, Tina.
- Reload!

255
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,941
He wasn't this good
at being evil overnight!

256
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,774
Reload!
Your time's coming.

257
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,314
It's jammed!

258
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,711
Huh?

259
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,177
Okay, who did that?

260
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,686
Uh...
Stuart!
Huh?

261
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,415
That was great!

262
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,115
Thank you!

263
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,429
Say, fellas,
can we get personal
for just a second?

264
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,524
Why are you going to Orlando?

265
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,597
Come on. You can tell us.
You're going to Villain-Con,
aren't you?

266
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,441
Villain-Con.

267
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,166
Villain-Con.

268
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,837
Wow! So many bad guys
in the car. What fun!

269
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,973
I knew it!
I knew you were villains!
Didn't I, honey?

270
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,848
What a small world!
Hope we're not
in rival gangs.

271
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,455
Binky! Joke!
Babies, huh?

272
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,909
Yay.

273
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,356
Big boss!

274
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,780
When we get to Orlando,

275
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,548
I'm gonna get all
my favorite villains
to sign my magazine!

276
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,181
Du mo the Sumo!

277
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,884
Boss!

278
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,896
Oh, Kevin,
you don't wanna work for him!
He ate his last henchmen!

279
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:40,953
Uh...

280
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,090
Frankie Fish Lips.

281
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,532
He lives in the ocean.

282
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,399
Boss?
Oh...

283
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,036
Can you breathe underwater?

284
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,538
Uh, so-so.

285
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,903
Oh, oh, oh!

286
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,739
Look at her!
Scarlet Overkill!

287
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,473
The coolest super-villain,
like, ever!

288
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,107
She started out
as your average little girl,
braces, pigtails.

289
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:04,551
But by the time she was 13,
she built a criminal empire!

290
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,386
If I was a Minion,
that's who I'd want
to work for!

291
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,620
Oh.

292
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,286
Here we are!
Beautiful Orlando!

293
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,796
Yeah! We're here!

295
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,617
Hey, gang, watch this!

296
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,985
<i>Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop.
 How can I help you?</i>

297
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,955
- Yeah, hi.
- Uh...

298
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,420
We're here for, uh,
so much fun, it's a crime.

299

All right!
Here we go!

302
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:19,688
Well, this is it!
I wanna tell you,
and I really mean this.

303
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,059
I really appreciate
what you did

304
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,894
back there
with the cops.
Really!

305
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,127
Dad!
It's Frankie Fish Lips!

306
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,227
I can smell him
from here!

307
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,669
Junior!
Get my camera!

308
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,798
Good luck in there, boys!

309
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,139
I hope you find what
you're looking for!

310
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,233

00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,077
Okay!

Oh!

316
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,985
Any evil talents?

317
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,255
Not bad.

318
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,031
What about you?
Any evil talents?

319
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,092
Uh...

320
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,333
Belle!
La, la, la!
La, la, la!

321
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,396
Eh?

322
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,908
That's not evil or a talent.

323
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,343
Belle!

324
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,077
Ha-ha!

325
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,511
No?

326
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,392
I'm sorry! But I'm
not looking for
any more servants,

Every time I visit the future,
I bring my future self
back to help me.

330
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,695
Hello!

331
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,963
Oh.

332
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,943
Move that over there,
Professor Flux from
two weeks from now.

333
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,038
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

334
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:51,717
Oh, way to go, guys.
We killed the original!

335

00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,918
I love you, Scarlet!

364
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,750
Look at all those
faces out there!

365
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,052
We are all so different!

366
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,990
But we have one
thing in common.

367
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,259
We were
born with flippers!

368
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,200
No? Just me? Okay.

369
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,761
We have big dreams!

370
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,432
And we will do anything
to make them come true!

371
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,576
Have any of you
ever dreamt

372
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,842
of working for the greatest
super-villain of all time?

373
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,448
Yeah!

374
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,574
Whoo-hoo!

375
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,256
Well, what if
I were to tell you

376
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,883
that I am looking
for new henchmen?

377
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,186
Hey, boss! Boss!

378
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,595
I truly believe
somewhere out there

379
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,636
is a villain
with the potential
to serve greatness!

380
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,434
And it could be any of you.

381
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,699
Whoa!

382
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,868
Although,
let's not kid ourselves.

383
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:31,608
Truly,
the only men for this job
are Kevin and his Minions!

384
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,705
- Huh? But... But...
- Ten times the evil

385
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,946
in half the package!
I am just in awe!

386
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,953
Let's hear it for Kevin.

387
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,718
He saved his tribe!

388
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,056
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

389
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,396
Kevin!
Kevin! Kevin...
Hey! Kevin. Hey. Hey!

390
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,626
Argh!

391
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,230
So, how should we
do this? Hmm.

392
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,131
Oh.

393
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,607
You see this
tiny little trinket?

394
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,270
Well, just take it from my
hand and you've got the job.

395
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,905
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

396
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,238
Uh...

397
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,807
Oh, come on!
Don't be afraid.

398
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,251
Just take the stone
and get that job!
Come on!

399
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,311
Oh, okay.

400
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,118
...Boss!

401
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,453
That job is mine!

402
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,584
Ooh!

403
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:24,861
Now go easy on me.

404
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,764
Whoops!

405
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,205
Love the costume!

406
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,431
Ha!

407
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,966
Uh...

408
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,874
So cool!

409
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,641
Tim? Tim!

410
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,879
Uh...

411
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,890
Oh, no, Bob!

412
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,222
Ah! Tim! Tim!

413
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,057
Is no one good enough?

414
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,291
Bob!

415
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,972
VILLAIN; I got it!
I got it!

416
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,215
Ah!

417
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,386
Didn't my speech inspire anyone

418
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,221
to rise up and
prove themselves worthy?

419
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,592
All these villains and
yet I still have the bear.

420
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,996
Stuffed bear!
Why am I holding a bear?

421
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,932
Who has the ruby?

422
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,002
Wow! Who...

423
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,846
Who are you, my knights
in shining denim?

424
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,680
...Stuart.

425
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,185
...Bob.
Minions!

426
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,620
That was incredible!

427
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:55,385
Behold! The last
creatures you'd expect

428
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,188
to win the day have
emerged victorious!

429
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,591
Everyone, meet my
new henchmen. The Minions!

430
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:07,067
Kumbaya!
Kumbaya! Kumbaya!

431
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,238
Kumbaya!

432
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:14,437
Hey!
I know those guys!
I gave them a ride here!

433
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,410
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

434
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,880
Buckle up, boys!
Next stop, England.

435
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,515
Oh...

436
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,004
Bello?

437
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,341
Hey, Kevin! Eh?

438
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,646
Boss? In England?

439
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:27,865
Nah,  Boss!

440
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,030
Ah, uh... Bello, Kevin?

441
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,293
...England?

442
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,198
- Uh-huh.
- ...Boss?

443
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,464
Scarlet Popapil. Ah.

444
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,483
- Bello? Belle!
-  Bello?

445
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,257
Oh!
Wow!

446
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,197
Ah!

447
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,273
Here we go! There.

448
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,774
By the way,
I really like your bear.

449
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,074
Herb! My baby!

450
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,670
You know I am!

451
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,238
How'd it go?

452
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,749
Were you evil?

453
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,911
So evil!
Oh!

454
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,420
A little bird
dropped this
off today.

455
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,589
It's me, I'm the

456
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,563
Also, there was no bird.
Also me.

457
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,432
Herb, seriously,
I wanna dig up
that William Shakespeare

458
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,800
so he can see
what true writing is.

459
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,099
I love it!

460
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,970
Ah, that works out
because I love...

461
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,977
Well, I love... too.

462
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,876
Ah, the love, ah!

463
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,643
Oh! Oh, ah.

464
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:09,742
Oh, boys,
could you
come here, please?

465
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:15,781
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

466
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,119
Herb, these are
the new recruits.

467
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,494
Kevin, Stuart, and that
cute little one is Bob.

468
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,827
Hey, belle!

469
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:27,734
Right on!
You guys are crazy
little and way yellow,

470
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,238
and I dig that!

471
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,904
Sweet, man!

472
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,235
Ah, ah.

473
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,907
Whoa!

474
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,748
I know,
right?
Ah!

475
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,812
Just a few things I
stole to help fill the void.

476
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,958
Whoa!
...mega ukulele!

477
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,620
Checkin' out my can?

478
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,495
We stole that
because finally someone

479
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,864
expressed my love of
soup in painting form.

480
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,300
Wow!
Ooh!

481
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,033
Okay, listen up!
It is time to get
down to business.

482
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,601
Do you know who this is?

483
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,878
Uh...

484
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,608
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

485
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,780
Oh, I love England.
The music, the fashion.

486
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,288
I'm seriously thinking
about overthrowing
it someday.

487
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,518
Ooh!

488
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,289
Anyway, this pale
drink of water
oversees it all.

489
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,332
I'm her biggest fan,
love her work!

490
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,334
And I really, really,
really want her crown.

491
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,540
Steal me the crown
and all your dreams come true.

492
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,975
Respect! Power!

493
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,307
Banana!

494
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,470
Banana!

495
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,641
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

496
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,818
Ha!

497
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,383
Henry!

498
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,597
...England. Uh...

499
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,491
...England...

500
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,550
Oh, uh...

501
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,363
Hmm.

502
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,591
Heh.

503
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,860
- Wow!
- Whoa.

504
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,591
Ooh-la-la.

505
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,432
No!
Oh, no.

506
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,903
Don't get too close, boys.

507
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,881
When it's completed,
it'll be my ultimate weapon.

508
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:49,367
But right now,
it's leaking radiation
like you would not believe!

509
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,110
So, you're here for gear.

510
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,113
Whoa!

511
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,549
Bob, Robert, Bobby, my boy.

512
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:05,060
You get my
far-out stretch suit.

513
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,454
Wow!

514
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,725
Kevin, Kev-bo,
Seventh Kevin,

515
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,895
you are the proud owner
of my lava lamp gun.

516
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,270
Ah?
This baby shoots
actual lava!

517
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,067
Ooh!

518
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,768
Pretty
cool, right?

519
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:25,611
And finally, Stu. Stu-art,
Stu-perman, Beef Stu.

520
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,583
I got you the
coolest invention,
probably ever.

521
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,176
Oh.

522
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,255
Hypno-hat!
Uh, oh.

523
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,678
Uh...

524
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,325
You can use it to
hypnotize anyone. Anyone!

525
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,329
Oh, you look <i>so</i> great!

526
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,300
I feel like a proud mama
with three

527
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,361
dashing evil sons.

528
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:52,601
Uh, Scarlet,
Scarlet...

529
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,440
No, no. Don't say anything.
I won't understand.

530
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,448
It's getting late.
You've had a big day,
you must be exhausted!

531
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,674
Boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing...

532
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,951
Wow! These cats
are pumped!

533
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,152
Well, maybe
I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story?

534
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,320
Ha-ha!

535
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,690
How does that sound, Bob?
Bob. Bob! Bob!

536
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,565
Oh! Bedtime porry?

537
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,901
That is a groovy idea!
I'll go get some
cookies and warm milk.

538
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,908
This is gonna be so fun!

539
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,307
...bedtime porry.

540
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,816
Oh, yes, I've got
a really, really good
bedtime porry.

541
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,720
Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

542
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:44,917
<i>One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big, bad wolf...</i>

543
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,392
<i>...who had a wonderful
surprise for them!</i>

544
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,593
<i>The wolf offered
the three piggies
and all their friends</i>

545
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,533
<i>a job working for her.</i>

546
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,368
<i>Everyone would be so happy!</i>

547
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,732
<i>All the three
little piggies had to do</i>

548
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,742
<i>was just steal one little crown</i>

549
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,506
<i>that the beautiful wolf
had wanted</i>

550
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:07,539
<i>ever since she was
a penniless little street cub,</i>

551
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,677
<i>unloved and abandoned.</i>

552
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,846
<i>But that crown would mean
she was a princess,</i>

553
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,086
<i>and everybody loves a princess!</i>

554
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:19,628
<i>So the wolf sent the piggies
in get that crown.</i>

555
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,093
<i>But the mile pigs
weren't up to the challenge.</i>

556
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,032
<i>They failed their mission.</i>

557
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:32,140
<i>So the wolf huffed and puffed,
and she blew them off
the face of {he earth!</i>

558
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,467
Yo, po, po!

559
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,276
The end.

560
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,654
Good luck getting
that crown tomorrow,
little piggies.

561
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,121
I know you won't disappoint me.

562
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:53,818
Um.

563
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,039
<i>So the wolf huffed and puffed,
and she blew them off
the face of {he earth!</i>

564
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,009
Okay.

565
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,113
...Scarlet.

566
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,842
Which way
is the loo, please?
Hmm.

567
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,007
Oh, thank you.
Ah.

568
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,951
Bello.

569
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,784
- Uh...
-  ...please.

570
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:24,156
You're not allowed
in without an adult.
Scram, hooligans!

571
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,659
Oh.

572
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,924
Uh, mm.

573
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,300
Ooh...

574
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,098
Oh, la...

575
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,667
Stuart...

576
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,937
How many tickets, please?

577
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,509
...please.

578
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,183
...please.

579
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,516
Enjoy yourself, love.

580
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,992
Thank you!

581
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,523
It was nowhere
near Hyde Park!

582
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,862
Bob's your uncle.

583
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,636
Huh, hmm.

584
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,569
Okay.

585
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,705
Okay.

586
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,543
Huh? Ah!

587
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,979
He-hey.

588
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,649
Okay.

589
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,710
Hey!

590
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,721
What are you doing here?

591
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,051
This is a restricted area!
Hands in the air!

592
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,755
No...

593
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,665
Stop that!

594
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,606
Get back.

595
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,219
Yay!

596
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,030
Ah!

597
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,768
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

598
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,609
Bob, Stuart...

599
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,085
So...

600
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,319
So, you came for
the Queen's crown, did you?

601
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,520
Well, you're gonna
have to get through me!

602
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,188
The Keeper of the Crown!

603
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,259
Ow! Hey!

604
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,135
You think it's
funny to mock the
elderly, do you?

605
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,173
Uh...

606
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,605
I've been up here for decades,

607
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,703
just waiting for someone to try

608
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:32,782
and steal the Queen's treasure!

609
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,976
Okay.

610
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,149
What are you saying?
Never mind, don't care!

611
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,284
Oh, no!

612
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,831
Oh, no, you don't!

613
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,957
Oh, flippin' heck!

614
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,695
What's gain' on?

615
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,705
Bob...

616
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,542
Eh... Hmm.
Wow.

617
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,041
Hello!

618
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,117
Huh?

619
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:56,524
Hello!

620
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,123
Stone the crows!

621
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,223
Stop him, lads!
Wait!

622
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,598
Go for the legs!

623
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,135
Gordon Bennett!

624
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,710
Kevin!

625
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,585
The Queen's
been kidnapped, Sarge!

626
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:17,711
Blimey!

627
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,316
Hyah! Hyah!

628
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,416
Ooh!

629
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,966
Ha! Boo-ya!

630
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,010
Huh. Hyah! Hyah!

631
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,307
What's going on?
Belle!

632
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,472
Oh, my goodness!

633
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:48,008
- Whoa!
- Ha-ha!

634
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,140
No!

635
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:55,254
Gentlemen do not
steal ladies' crowns!

636
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:57,953
Huh? Hmm?

637
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,592
Huh?

638
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,841
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

639
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,839
Oh, dear!

640
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,785
Ah! Ahhh!

641
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,025
Yeah!

642
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:36,530
You scoundrel!
After them!
Uh-oh.

643
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,996
Stop the blighter!

644
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,841
Go on, grab him!

645
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,465
Huh?

646
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,311
Huh? Oh.

647
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,423
Cor, blimey!

648
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,654
One of England's
most famous myths
has become a reality

649
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,726
as a new king has been crowned.

650
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:14,030
Bob, who appears to be
a bald, jaundiced child,

651
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,503
has pulled the famed sword
right from its stone,

652
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,268
<i>which, legend dictates,
makes him the new king.</i>

653
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,367
Tiny yellow traitor!

654
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,284
England!

655
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,293
England! England!

656
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,728
England!
England! England!

657
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,631
England! England...

658
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,941
Ha, ha!

659
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,228
Belle!

660
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:15,553
Bello!

661
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,790
Cut!

662
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,003
Hey, Bob.

663
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,451
- Hello, King Bob.
- Uh...

664
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,081
Welcome to Buckingham Palace.

665
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,284
Uh, no.

666
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,121
Oh, what's the matter,
Your Majesty?

667
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,288
Whatever's bothering you,
we can make it right.

668
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,524
Just name it!

669
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,621
Oh.

670
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,700
Buddies!

671
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,861
Buddies! Buddies!

672
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,197
Buddies!

673
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,478
Oh.

674
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,047
Uh...

675
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,019
King Bob!

676
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,857
Long live the king!

677
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,864
King Bob!

678
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,138
...Bob...
...King...

679
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,488
So...

680
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,026
King Bob!

681
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,514
Oh... Yeah!

682
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,006
King Bob! Wait!

683
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,350
- Wow!
- Whoa!

684
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,353
Whoo-hoo!

685
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:25,383
Oh...

686
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,450
Yee-haw!

687
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,620
King Bob!

688
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:28,930
Hyah:

689
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,874
Hmm? Huh! Ah!

690
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,705
Yes, King Bob. Oh.

691
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,941
King Bob?

692
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:52,914
King Bob?

693
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,317
Ah, Claire.

694
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:55,789
Mmm, Tiffany.

695
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,215
Rawr!

696
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,491
Ball!

697
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,261
How dare you!

698
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,339
Scarlet!

699
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:21,177
Don't you "Scarlet" me,
you backstabbing
little traitors!

700
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:24,082
Using Herb's invention
to steal my crown?

701
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,653
I feel used.
Not gonna lie.

702
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:34,492
You stole my dream!
I was going to conquer
England someday!

703
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,496
There was gonna
be a coronation,

704
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,090
and I was going
lobe made Queen.

705
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,999
Every moment was planned.

706
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,470
I'd wear a dress so sparkly,
it glowed!

707
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:48,806
And everyone who
ever doubted me
would be watching,

708
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,710
and they would be crying!

709
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:55,443
I was going to be
the picture of
elegance and class!

710
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,214
And you pinheads screwed it up!

711
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,152
No, no, no!

712
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:05,687
No, no, no, King Bob!
You cannot just
abdicate the throne!

713
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,456
Who invited the square?

714
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:11,193
And you definitely
cannot just give
the job to this woman!

715
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,665
There are laws!

716
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,825
Boss.
...Boss.

717
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,403
...Scarlet Popapil!

718
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,069
King Bob has
officially changed the law,

719
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:25,875
clearing the way
for Scarlet Overkill

720
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,847
to be crowned Queen of England!

721
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:31,250
She will be coronated
at London's historic
Westminster Abbey.

722
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:35,222
If I wasn't so polite,
I'd say this spells
certain doom for the country,

723
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,814
if not the world.

724
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,486
But I'm so very polite
that I shall
keep my mouth shut.

725
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,995
But, seriously,
we're all in big trouble.

726
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,760
Scarlet! Scarlet!

727
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,236
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

728
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,998
I just want to
thank the Minions

729
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:53,337
for going above and
beyond the call of duty.

730
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,401
You are three tiny, golden...

731
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,946
...pill-shaped
miracle workers,

732
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:03,542
and you have stolen
not just England
but my heart.

733
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,086
Scarlet, over here!

734
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,921
Pardon me?

735
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,716
Eh?

736
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,924
Wow! <i>So</i> many!
Good for you!

737
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,931
Well, you'll all
get what you deserve.

738
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,898
Serve!
...serve!

739
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,527
Whoo-hoo!

740
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,786
Oh.

741
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,762
Go ahead, go ahead.

742
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,397
Uh...

743
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,343
Uh...

744
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:06,574
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I hate you.

745
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:11,451
I thought I could
get over what you did,
but I feel so betrayed.

746
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,485
I think...
Yes, I think we're gonna
have to break up.

747
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,026
And it's not you.

748
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:22,757
Wait, hold on.
It is you. It's 100% you!

749
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,197
No, no.

750
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:28,668
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real, real comfortable.

751
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,171
Because this is where
you're going to spend

752
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:35,266
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

753
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:40,779
All right!
Let's do this!

754
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:42,544
Herb!

755
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,778
Who's this
handsome "Herb" fella?

756
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:48,517
No, my name is "Blerb."
I'm a dungeon master.

757
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,557
Prepare for torture,
which I do!

758
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:57,732
All right, are we comfy?
Doesn't matter!
This is torture!

759
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,194
- Huh.
- Oh.

760
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:07,632
Wow! Harder than I thought.
Next machine!

761
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:12,576
Oh, welcome to Hang Town!
Population, you!

762
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,307
Oh.

763
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,576
Whoo-hoo!

764
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:22,157
Cut it out! This is
really unprofessional!

765
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,055
There's no laughing
in the dungeon!

766
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,685
I wanna see tears and
I wanna hear screams,

767
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,923
or I'm gonna get... Wait!

768
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,021
Hey!
Ooh! I've got a groovy idea!

769
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:32,089
Ah!

770
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,226
Look at this!
Argh!

771
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,681
<i>Hello!
Will the future king,
Herb Overkill,</i>

772
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,182
<i>please come upstairs
to prepare for the coronation?</i>

773
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,548
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson for today.

774
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:56,684
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time!

775
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,423
I don't even know
anyone named "Blerb"!

776
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,293
Uh, Herb...

777
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,790
Oh. Huh.

778
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:10,598
I am hours away
from becoming
the Queen of England!

779
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,571
I know!
It's a gas!

780
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,575
I will finally
get my crown.
Yeah.

781
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,078
It's all I've ever wanted.
I'm going to be so happy.

782
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:22,479
But let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

783
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:25,554
Does that look
like this to you?

784
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:33,588
Mrs. Overkill,
the hair in that picture,
it's just two wavy lines!

785
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,421
Oh, so, what,
now you're an art critic?

786
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:40,902
I drew that when
I was five years old!
Get out of my sight!

787
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,140
Bye, Fabrice!

788
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,769
I liked him. He was fun.

789
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,413
So, what do you
think of the dress?

790
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:57,077
Oh, it's so beautiful.
So fashion-forward.
So Valentino.

791
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,311
Gave it a sweetheart
neckline because
you're my sweetheart.

792
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,117
The high collar
and cinched waist

793
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,489
reflect a simpler,
more violent time.

794
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,119
The material is
a blend of taffeta
and high-density body armor.

795
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,664
Fully armed and loaded.

796
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:13,492
And that glow, that's nuclear.

797
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,627
Nice. Just one more
thing to do.

798
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,694
Gotta look good for the public.

799
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,795
Ugh.

800
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,197
Do you mind?

801
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:21,298
My pleasure.

802
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,773
Little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

803
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,375
Little tighter.

804
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:30,452
Tighter!

805
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,215
Must have tiny waist.

806
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,480
Seeing stars, seeing stars!

807
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,457
Losing feeling in
my legs. Perfect!
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

808
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:43,820
Huh?

809
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,995
Ah. Bob! Stuart!

810
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,331
Eh?

811
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,844
- Ooh! Bello!
-  Ooh-ooh!

812
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,809
Ah! Oh.

813
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,049
Ah.

814
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,690
Huh!

815
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:18,088
Ah.

816
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:24,404
- Eh, eh, Kevin...
- ...Scarlet.

817
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,670
Ah!

818
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,413
"Porry Scarlet."

819
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,752
- He, he!
- ...Boss.

820
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,110
Oh.

821
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,423
Ah, okay!

822
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,053
Huh?

823
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,440
I love you, Scarlet!

824
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,382
Queen wave, queen wave!
Queen waving!

825
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:21,396
I am so, so excited!
This is perfect!

826
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,453
Everyone looks so nice!

827
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:27,092
Oh! Oh, you are just adorable!

828
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:29,927
Oh, yes!

829
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,563
And that music, oh!

830
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:36,945
Who is that organist?
She is good! Right?
She looks like an Edna.

831
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,675
Edna, you are very good!
Who was that? Whoa!

832
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,750
Thanks for doing this,
padre. Big fan.
Uh-huh.

833
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,485
Come here,
let me squeeze you!
Oh, you are so squishy!

834
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,157
...Scarlet.

835
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,323
Go, go, Go!

836
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,378
Ouch! Ouch!

837
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:16,847
...sayonara!

838
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,545
Ciao...

839
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,466
Bob...

840
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,831
Stuart!

841
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,670
Aww! 00-ooh!

842
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,750
Okay!

843
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,011
Oh! Beh...

844
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,521
Will you to your power

845
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:58,718
cause law
and justice...

846
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,226
...Popapil!

847
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:03,420
Oh!
Ah...

848
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:05,766
Hmm? Ah...

849
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,494
Huh? Uh... Uh...

850
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:13,402
Stopa!

851
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,033
Bah!

852
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,710
In mercy...

853
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:25,851
No, no, no!

854
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,681
Do you, Scarlet Overkill...

855
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,266
Yeah!

856
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:41,802
Huh? Oh?

857
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:43,064
No!

858
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,700
Uh, mmm...

859
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,744
...Bob.

860
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,593
I proclaim thee,
Scarlet Overkill,

861
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,825
the Queen of England!
Oh! Huh?

862
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,459
Kevin!

863
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:16,560
Huh?

864
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,506
Scarlet! Scarlet,
my queen?

865
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,343
Somebody help me!

866
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:33,650
Come on, come on!
Lift on two. One, two!

867
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,747
One, two!

868
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,823
Huh?

869
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,795
Scarlet! You're okay!

870
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,499
He tried to kill me!

871
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,369
Uh, no...

872
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:59,175
Villains, this is no
longer a coronation!
It is an execution!

873
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,805
Get them!

874
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:08,289
Whoa, Nelly!
Run, fellas, run!

875
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:15,693
Come back here, you!

876
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:20,290
Ah!

877
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,338
Uh?

878
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,043
Hyah:

879
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,254
Aah!

880
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,691
You're mine!

881
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:56,032
Stuart, Bob! Uh...

882
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,906
Oops!

883
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,911
Oh!

884
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,615
Hey! I got one!

885
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,934
Tim!

886
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,037
Huh?

887
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:45,380
Oh? Aww! Oh!

888
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,614
Uh? Eh?

889
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,481
Tim!

890
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,498
Stuart! Bob!

891
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,667
Buddies!

892
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,697
<i>Mind</i> the gap.

893
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,111
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

894
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,280
Mind the gap!
Mind the gap! Mind the gap!

895
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,908
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

896
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,247
Mind the gap!

897
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,149
He won't get away!

898
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,450
He won't escape us!

899
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,758
Huh?

900
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,989
What about this one?

901
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:34,428
Why did the queen
go to the dentist?

902
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,130
To get her teeth crowned.

903
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,469
Heh!

904
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,702
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

905
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:42,799
Uh, uh...

906
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,470
Bello!
 Oh!

907
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:45,706
It's you.

908
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:48,510
Everyone, this is one
of the little fellows

910
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,686
And how's that
working out for you?

911
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,949
Uh, Scarlet...

912
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,822
Oh, yes, yes, I saw what
was going on on the telly.

913
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,020
Uh, telly?

914
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,857
<i>What was meant to
be the coronation of</i>

<i>Kevin, Kevin,
I know you're out there.</i>

918
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:15,299
<i>You think you've gotten away?
Well, what do we have here?</i>

919
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,366
<i>Bella!</i>

920
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,241
Oh, my goodness!
Bob? Stuart?

921
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,712

<i>Bob! Stuart!</i>

924
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:31,188
<i>I will do it, Kevin,
if you are not
back here by dawn!</i>

925
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,916
Oh, my!

926
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,017
No!

927

There he is!

930
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,085
Follow me!

931
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,587
Ah! Ha-haa!

932
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,356
Who the man, eh?

933

Uh... Oh!

934
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:16,564
Oh.

935
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:20,268
Harder! It's just my head.

936
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,371
Oh, no!

937
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,810
This way! Let's get him!

938
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:26,244
Go, go, go!

939
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,215
No!

940
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,424
Huh?

941
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,630
Oh.

942
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,173

947
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:43,222
This is it, boys!

948
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,622
Things do not
look good for you.

949
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,285
Oh, and I'm keeping the bear.

950
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,829
Tim!

951
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,331
You're not gonna need him
where you're going.

952
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:52,627
Heaven.

953
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,230

01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:10,711
Bye-bye. Say bye-bye,
Bob. Bye-bye!

Oh, whoa!

Wait, what? How did he...

Hold my bear.

961
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,187
Huh?

962
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,449
Yippee! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Kevin!

963
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,782
So, that's your plan?

964
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:28,123
Make yourself a bigger target?

965
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:35,593
Huh?

966
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,638
K-K-Kevin? Hey!

967
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,297
...Kevin!

968
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,344
Whoa!

969
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,821
Ow!

970
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,125
And so help me,

971
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:07,429
I never wanna
see another one of

your goofy, bug-eyed
faces ever again!

What?

01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,469
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

Whoa!

977
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,855
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs,

978
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:34,292
you can thank Kevin
for what I'm
about to do to you!

979
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,522
Ow! Ow!

980
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,635
Bob! Stuart!
Buddies!

Ooh! Aah! Kevin! Kevin!

988
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:16,065
Enough! This ends now!

Kevin!

990
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:48,795
You imbecile!
Have fun exploding!

991
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,029
Baby!

992
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,234
What's the rush?

993
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:53,467
Got to get out of here!

994
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,438
Let us go!

995
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:07,251
No, no, no, no!

996
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:18,295
Kevin!

997
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,280
Kevin...

998
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,006
Huh?

999
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,329
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

1000
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:26,856
Ooh!

Hmm.

1002

Bob?

1003

<i>Okay.</i>

1004

Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here today
to celebrate the Minions!

1005
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,518
Huh!

1006
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:21,847
The country owes you
a great debt of gratitude.

1007
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:27,684
Bob, you were
a wise and noble king
for all of eight hours.

1008
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:33,700
So for you,
I offer this tiny crown
for your teddy bear. Tim.

1009
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,404
Oh, very good, Bob!

1010
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,435
Oh, spectacular!

1011

For you,
I have this beautiful,
super-duper, incredible...

Yippee.
Uh, eh, <i>gracias</i>.

1019
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:13,497
Stuart, we're just
messing with you!

1020
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:17,604
Don't be mad at me,
it was Kevin's idea.

1021
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,669
Kevin!

1022
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,750
We have a much
better surprise for you!

Thank you.

1027
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,358
Right. Uh...

1028
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:08,554
And finally, Kevin!

1029
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:14,991
You are a hero of
the highest order.

1030
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:19,301
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

1031
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:23,340
From here on out,
you are Sir Kevin.

1032
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,506
Well done.

1033
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:37,852
<i>What a beautiful moment!</i>

1034

thousand years were rough,

<i>But something was missing.</i>

1040
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,909
Yes, good show, good show!

1041
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,608
My crown is gone! It's gone!

1042
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:07,119
Blimey!

1043
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,052

...Scarlet! Hey!

1047

They took everything from me!
My castle! My reputation!

1048
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,302
Things look bleak,
baby, I'm not gonna lie!

1049
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:30,605
But now at least
I have my crown!

1050
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,553
Child,
give me that back.

1051
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:51,426
No, I don't think so!

1052
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:54,798
You have no idea who
you're messing with!

1053
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,734
I am the greatest
super-villain of all time!

Are you really going to
allow that little penguin

1060
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:38,174
