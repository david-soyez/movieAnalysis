2
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,313
Where are you going?

3
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:57,917
I won't be long.

4
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,097
Bottoms up.

5
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,913
Start anywhere you like.

6
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,690
Take your time, 007, but in five minutes
the head of the Joint Security Service

7
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,393
is going to walk through that door,
and I've got to explain to him

8
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:54,731
how one of our agents decided
to potter off to Mexico,

9
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,365
all on his own, and cause
an international incident.

10
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,667
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.

11
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,803
Worse? You blew up half a bloody block.

12
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,479
Well, better half a block
than a whole stadium full of people.

13
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,241
You had no authority.

14
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,545
None. As you know, we're in
the middle of the biggest shakeup

15
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,080
in the history of British intelligence.

16
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,816
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5

17
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,586
and already they're itching for a chance
to scrap the double-0 program forever.

18
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,871
And you've just given them one.

19
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,658
You're right, sir.

20
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,125
You have got a tricky day ahead.

21
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:31,599
This is an official question.

22
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:35,770
Mexico City. What were you doing there?

23
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,773
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

24
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,845
Okay. Fine.

25
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:46,681
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

26
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:50,389
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

27
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,793
Very good, sir.

28
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,028
007?

29
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,533
Sir?

30
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:09,937
I don't know what you're playing at,
but whatever it is, it has to stop.

31
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,836
Now.

32
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,043
- So sorry. Am I interrupting?
- Not remotely.

33
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:18,746
007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh,
head of the Joint Security Service.

34
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:22,650
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you. Most of it good.

35
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,352
- Congratulations on your new appointment.
- Thank you.

36
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,890
- I suppose we should call you C now.
- No, no. "Max," please.

37
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,598
No, I think I'll call you C... C.

38
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,795
As you wish.

39
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:39,224
Well, my door is always open, 007,
for my employees.

40
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,536
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.

41
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:45,148
We're going to bring British intelligence
out of the Dark Ages...

42
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,142
into the light.

43
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,277
That all sounds lovely.

44
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:53,584
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.

45
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,468
Very good, sir.

46
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,762
- James?
- Moneypenny.

47
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:12,333
- So? How was the meeting?
- Very good, thank you.

48
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,870
- Here. Forensics finally released this.
- What is it?

49
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,772
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

50
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:21,378
- Perfect. You can bring it to me later.
- What do you mean?

51
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,809
My place, 9:00.

52
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,762
- Evening.
- Come in.

53
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:43,153
- Have you just moved in?
- No.

54
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:46,664
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

55
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,358
Your delivery.

56
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,320
Thank you.

57
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,278
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not staying.

58
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,244
That's a shame.

59
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,613
What's going on, James?

60
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,586
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.

61
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,823
Talking about what, exactly?

62
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,827
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

63
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,331
- That you're finished.
- And what do you think?

64
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,798
I think you're just getting started.

65
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,103
I don't know what you mean.

66
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,136
All right.

67
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:27,409
I think you've got a secret.

68
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,712
And it's something
you won't tell anyone.

69
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,555
Because you don't trust anyone.

70
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:48,495
<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

71
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:52,898
<i>Find a man called Marco Sciarra.</i>

72
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:55,135
<i>Kill him.</i>

73
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,736
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

74
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:02,207
Jesus.

75
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,756
- Where did you get it?
- In my mailbox just after she died.

76
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:10,615
Well, she was never short of surprises.

77
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:14,519
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

78
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,678
I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.

79
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,395
- And what have you found?
- Nothing significant yet.

80
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,729
When's the funeral?

81
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,300
Three days. In Rome.

82
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,390
If you think M's signing off
on that, you're insane.

83
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,307
- He won't let you out of his sight.
- Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

84
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:38,312
Listen... could you do
a little quiet digging for me?

85
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:42,013
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."

86
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,418
You want me to be your mole.

87
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,420
Yes.

88
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,309
And what makes you think
you can trust me?

89
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:57,496
Instinct.

90
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,860
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

91
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:05,344
Cheaper to knock her down
than to rebuild.

92
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,934
Still.

93
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:10,000
Time waits for no man and all that.

94
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:14,005
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this...

95
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,176
the New Centre for National Security.

96
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,898
So that's C's new digs.

97
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:22,466
You've met him, have you?

98
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:26,987
- Yesterday. What do we know about him?
- Classic Whitehall mandarin.

99
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:30,291
Wrote a dossier last year on how
the double-0 program was obsolete,

100
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,627
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

101
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:36,797
- Went to school with the Home Secretary.
- Of course, he did.

102
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,133
This merger's just the start of it.

103
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,904
In three days, there's a security conference
in Tokyo to decide the New World Order.

104
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,173
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

105
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:49,096
to the combined the intelligence
streams of nine countries.

106
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,094
Including us.

107
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:52,906
Quite.

108
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,236
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

109
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,394
A train bombing in Hamburg
and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

110
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:11,666
It's not great timing for us.
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

111
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:16,137
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

112
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:17,505
Yeah, I've noticed.

113
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:22,103
Now, this way, 007.
Be careful. It's a trifle slippery.

114
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:28,149
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home
in Whitehall, what with the new merger,

115
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:32,473
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.

116
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:35,355
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.

117
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:37,629
I can hardly wait.

118
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:50,271
007.

119
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:52,640
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.

120
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,490
Everything's a little bit up in the air,
what with the changes and all.

121
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,098
Couple of things to get through.

122
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,682
Shall we get started?

123
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:03,215
Just relax.

124
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:07,388
That's it. Lovely.
Now, you may feel a small...

125
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:10,022
- Christ!
- ...prick.

126
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:15,129
- What is it?
- Cutting-edge nanotechnology.

127
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,470
Smart Blood.

128
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:23,186
Microchips in your bloodstream. Allows us
to track your movements in the field.

129
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,406
You see those readouts?

130
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:29,243
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

131
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:31,777
Well, that sounds marvelous.

132
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:34,731
Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.

133
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:37,315
By direct order of M.

134
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,252
I completely understand.

135
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,740
Good.

136
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,809
Right. Well, I've just...

137
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:49,628
got one last thing for you
and you can be on your way.

138
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,705
Magnificent, isn't she?

139
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:02,187
Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.
Fully bulletproof.

140
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,941
A few little tricks up her sleeve.

141
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:10,902
It's a shame, really. She was meant for you,
but she's been reassigned to 009.

142
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:13,976
But you can have this.

143
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:22,697
- Does it do anything?
- It tells the time.

144
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:25,585
- Might help with your punctuality issues.
- M's idea?

145
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,499
Precisely.

146
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:32,604
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.

147
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:36,375
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.

148
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:45,153
Oh, yes. That old thing
is taking quite a bit of time.

149
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:49,856
Mind you, there wasn't much left
to work on. Only a steering wheel.

150
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:54,393
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one
piece," not, "Bring back one piece."

151
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:02,654
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.

152
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,008
- Q?
- Yes?

153
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:11,709
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.

154
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,663
- Will you do something for me?
- What do you have in mind, exactly?

155
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:19,835
Make me disappear.

156
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:25,525
May I remind you
that I answer directly to M.

157
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:28,462
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.

158
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:31,699
Well, then I suggest you trust me...

159
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,532
for the sake of the cats.

160
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,541
Well, it's lovely to see you, 007.
Lovely.

161
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,743
Now, I meant to tell you,

162
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:46,547
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.

163
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:52,150
So we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours...

164
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,024
48 hours after administration,

165
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:59,922
but after that it should work perfectly.

166
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:04,666
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Please, don't.

167
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:37,164
- Morning. What's that?
- Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

168
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:40,365
- It's not your birthday, is it?
- No, sir.

169
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,276
That was last week.

170
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:44,605
Morning.

171
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:48,542
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.

172
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:51,398
Oh, good. Yes, fine.

173
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:07,317
Oh, shit.

174
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,687
I'm sorry for your loss.

175
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:18,693
- You knew my husband?
- All too briefly.

176
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:22,763
- What do you do?
- Life insurance.

177
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:25,319
A little late for that.

178
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,640
For your husband, yes.
But what about you?

179
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:31,725
Me?

180
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:36,374
I hear the life expectancy
of some widows can be very short.

181
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,780
How can you talk like this?

182
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,882
Can't you see I'm grieving?

183
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,350
No.

184
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,124
What a lovely view.

185
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,962
You're wasting your time.

186
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:12,599
There are 100 more
that will come after me.

187
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,535
All you buy me is five minutes.

188
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:20,599
Excellent. Time for a drink.

189
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,019
You killed him...

190
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:35,188
didn't you? My husband.

191
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:39,871
He was an assassin.
Trust me, he won't take it personally.

192
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,583
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

193
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:49,837
- Loyal to a man you hated.
- He trusted my silence.

194
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:52,172
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.

195
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:54,555
- I can trust nobody.
- I know the feeling well.

196
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:57,160
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.

197
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,063
Well, then you have
impeccable instincts.

198
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:03,047
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.

199
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,519
I can think of worse ways to go.

200
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:13,106
Then you're obviously crazy, Mister...

201
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,927
Bond.

202
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:19,756
James Bond.

203
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,441
These people...

204
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:34,693
if you just knew what they could do.

205
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:37,651
The power they have.

206
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:41,423
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"

207
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:43,797
No.

208
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:47,383
The organization...

209
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:51,045
they hardly ever meet.

210
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:56,419
But because of what happened
to my husband,

211
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,689
- they meet tonight.
- Why?

212
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:02,526
To choose a replacement.

213
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,492
Where?

214
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:07,865
The Palazzo Cardenza.

215
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,879
- Midnight.
- Sounds like fun. I might drop by.

216
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:15,038
He was obsessed.

217
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:19,273
He spent more time
with them than with me.

218
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,898
Then the man was a fool.

219
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:36,459
Leaving your number?

220
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,596
I've called an American
friend of mine. Felix.

221
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,332
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.

222
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,565
You'll be safe.

223
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,565
Don't go, James.

224
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:59,190
If you go there, you're crossing over
to a place where there is no mercy.

225
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,349
I have to go.

226
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,538
Bona fortuna, Dona Lucia.

227
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:25,234
...pharmacy sites has provided
an excellent new sales platform.

228
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:29,873
We have adapted many of them into
clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

229
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,507
In addition to which,

230
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:37,280
the latest figures show that we presently
control 70% of antimalarial vaccines,

231
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,752
34% of H.I.V., and 40%
of all oncological drugs

232
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,754
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

233
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:48,491
But we face challenges from the WHO

234
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:52,296
in their campaign against
our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

235
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:56,808
We have now identified
the key individuals to target.

236
00:38:56,983 --> 00:39:01,202
We expect the same success as we had
against the Council on Human Trafficking.

237
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,872
Don't let me interrupt you.

238
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:31,128
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, on to the matter at hand.

239
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,964
After the success of our attacks
in Hamburg and Tunisia,

240
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,467
the aborted attack in Mexico City

241
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:41,471
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,

242
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,941
leaves one of his duties outstanding.

243
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,245
Signor Guerra, The Pale King
must be terminated.

244
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:51,846
Will you make the journey to Altaussee?

245
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:50,452
Does anyone challenge
Signor Guerra for this position?

246
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:19,701
Welcome. State your credentials
for succeeding Signor Sciarra.

247
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:15,723
It's funny.

248
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:22,514
All that excitement in Mexico City
rang a distant bell.

249
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,899
And now...

250
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:30,704
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.

251
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,157
Welcome, James.

252
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,184
It's been a long time.

253
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:47,091
But, finally, here we are.

254
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:53,060
What took you so long?

255
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,921
Cuckoo.

256
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,441
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

257
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:26,962
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

258
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:46,940
No.

259
00:46:54,676 --> 00:46:56,506
Moneypenny.

260
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:01,787
- Bond?
- Listen, Moneypenny.

261
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,420
Hamburg, Tunisia, Mexico City,
they're all linked.

262
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,290
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.

263
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,926
- So, she was right.
- <i>Of course, she was.</i>

264
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:12,007
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

265
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:17,539
Oh, my boss had his credit card stolen.
It's nothing.

266
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,956
- Why don't you go back to sleep.
- Don't be long.

267
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:21,570
- Who was that?
- <i>No one.</i>

268
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,320
- <i>No, it wasn't.</i>
- It's just a friend.

269
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,575
At this time of night?

270
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:29,406
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.

271
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,424
<i>The Pale King. It looks like you've had
dealings with him before. Quantum.</i>

272
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,258
- Of course. Mr. White!
- <i>That's him.</i>

273
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:47,764
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

274
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,297
Hold that thought.

275
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:04,113
- You still there?
- Yeah.

276
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:07,617
- Run another name, will you?
- Okay. Go.

277
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:11,418
A man called Franz Oberhauser. He's...

278
00:48:13,322 --> 00:48:16,092
And check his files
before and after his death.

279
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:17,927
After his death?
What are you talking about?

280
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,305
Please, just do it.

281
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,579
Okay, Q, give me something.

282
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:00,861
That's more like it.

283
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:08,769
Here goes nothing.

284
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,940
Good evening.

285
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:06,762
Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.

286
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:10,566
We need more. Much more.

287
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:14,336
I say again, the Nine Eyes committee
would have full access

288
00:51:14,436 --> 00:51:17,740
to the combined intelligence streams
of all member states.

289
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,509
More data, more analysis,

290
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:24,061
less likelihood of a terrorist attack.

291
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:29,482
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
the security services of the world to unite.

292
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,688
Alone, we are weak.

293
00:51:32,788 --> 00:51:35,880
Together, we're a global power.

294
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,758
An unelected one.

295
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:41,311
Thank you.

296
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,632
Thank you.

297
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:45,802
We will now vote on the resolution.

298
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:49,542
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

299
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,879
The vote is eight to one in favor.

300
00:51:56,979 --> 00:52:02,017
However, as you know, we cannot
proceed unless by unanimous vote.

301
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,945
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

302
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:06,855
Democracy.

303
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:11,024
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
This evening's session is adjourned.

304
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:29,411
- Yes, sir.
- Please, tell me 007 is in London.

305
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:33,449
Oh, yes. I'll just take a look now, sir.

306
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,583
Because if he isn't,
you're in deep shit.

307
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:39,968
<i>You've got precisely 10 seconds.</i>

308
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,828
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

309
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:49,231
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

310
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:52,199
I completely understand...

311
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:54,334
sir.

312
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:49,111
Do me a favor. Make it quick.

313
00:55:49,511 --> 00:55:51,695
Upstairs, Mr. White.

314
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:07,159
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face, but not yours.

315
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:10,664
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

316
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,739
I was at a meeting recently
and your name came up.

317
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,811
I'm flattered London
is still talking about me.

318
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:22,278
It wasn't MI6.

319
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,777
It was Rome.

320
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,847
Your team, not mine.

321
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:37,627
Last month, I found thallium
in my cell phone.

322
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:42,962
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

323
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,603
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

324
00:56:47,703 --> 00:56:50,523
two dead men enjoying the evening.

325
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:54,410
- What did you do?
- I disobeyed him.

326
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:58,941
I followed him as far as I could. He...

327
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:02,584
- changed.
- Oh, I see.

328
00:57:02,684 --> 00:57:04,268
You grew a conscience.

329
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,588
Our game is our game. But this?

330
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,377
Women, children...

331
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:14,930
Well, the thallium would suggest that
he doesn't like you very much anymore.

332
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,049
And clearly the feeling is mutual.

333
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:19,268
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

334
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:21,370
Oh, come on.

335
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,873
- Tell me where he is.
- He's everywhere.

336
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:27,633
Everywhere! He's sitting at your desk,

337
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:31,745
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

338
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:41,655
You're protecting someone.

339
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:44,323
Your wife.

340
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,198
She left long ago.

341
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,331
Your son?

342
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:56,436
Your daughter.

343
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:01,577
You won't find her. She's clever.

344
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:05,023
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

345
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:09,249
I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.

346
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:15,788
- I can keep her alive.
- Yeah.

347
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:21,127
- You have my word.
- Your word?

348
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:23,896
The word of an assassin!

349
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,154
That's my word.

350
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,590
L'Americain.

351
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:12,112
You save her, she can lead you to
L'Americain. She knows L'Americain.

352
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:15,815
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

353
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:26,719
You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

354
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:30,923
So long.

355
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:27,523
I can't deny I'm impressed you got
H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

356
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:29,959
Good God, the government
couldn't afford this kind of facility.

357
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,828
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

358
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:36,098
When it goes online, this building
will be the most sophisticated

359
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:41,436
data gathering system in history.
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

360
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:44,395
- George Orwell's worst nightmare.
- I'm glad you like it.

361
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,826
My commiserations on losing
the Nine Eyes vote. Must've been a blow.

362
01:00:48,926 --> 01:00:52,480
Not really. Only a matter of time
before the South Africans see the light.

363
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,852
And you know what they say, Rome wasn't
built in a day. Day and a half maybe.

364
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:00,720
Look, Max, I know surveillance
is a fact of life.

365
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:05,727
It's how you use the information
that concerns me, and who is using it.

366
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,830
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

367
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,638
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

368
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,502
Come on, M. You can't really tell me
that one man in the field

369
01:01:14,602 --> 01:01:19,106
can compete with all of this, running
around out there with his license to kill.

370
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:22,376
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

371
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:28,017
Have you? To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

372
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:33,021
Yes, you investigate, analyze,
assess, target.

373
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:36,155
And then you have
to look him in the eye.

374
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:38,393
And you make the call.

375
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:41,863
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

376
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:44,532
all the surveillance in the world

377
01:01:44,632 --> 01:01:47,506
can't tell you what to do next.

378
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:50,439
A license to kill...

379
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:53,757
is also a license not to kill.

380
01:01:55,744 --> 01:01:58,380
I didn't want to have to do this,

381
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,191
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.

382
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:05,600
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

383
01:02:06,922 --> 01:02:09,691
<i>Looks like you've had dealings
with him before. Quantum.</i>

384
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,793
<i>Of course. Mr. White!</i>

385
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:15,130
<i>Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.</i>

386
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,297
<i>Run another name, will you?</i>

387
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:21,301
So maybe there's something to be said
for total surveillance after all.

388
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:26,594
You watch MI6 agents?

389
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:30,347
We watch everyone.

390
01:03:36,077 --> 01:03:39,880
Please, take a seat.
I'll be with you in just a moment.

391
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:58,798
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

392
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:02,771
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

393
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:07,242
Our job today is to analyze your needs,
both psychological and physical.

394
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:09,875
Sounds pretty straightforward.

395
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,794
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

396
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:14,497
I hadn't noticed.

397
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:23,558
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

398
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:28,263
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.

399
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:32,167
- Do you exercise?
- When I have to.

400
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:35,302
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?

401
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:40,274
- Sometimes.
- How much alcohol do you consume?

402
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:41,508
Too much.

403
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:46,047
Some broader questions.

404
01:04:46,147 --> 01:04:48,550
As a child, would you say
you were close to your parents?

405
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,451
My parents died when I was young.

406
01:04:51,953 --> 01:04:54,122
Really? How old?

407
01:04:54,222 --> 01:04:57,426
- Old enough to remember.
- How, if I may ask?

408
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,561
It was a climbing accident.

409
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:02,964
- So who brought you up?
- Someone else.

410
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:05,299
Humor me.

411
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:09,137
How does one train at Oxford
and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

412
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:12,141
spend two years
with Medecins Sans Frontieres...

413
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,048
and end up here?

414
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:19,579
Forgive me, but... anyone might think
you were hiding from something.

415
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:23,518
You're paying a lot of money
to be here, Mr. Bond.

416
01:05:23,618 --> 01:05:28,054
- Who's asking the questions, you or me?
- Of course. Carry on.

417
01:05:31,526 --> 01:05:34,563
I see you left
this final question blank.

418
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:36,331
What is your occupation?

419
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:40,535
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

420
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:43,902
- And why is that?
- I kill people.

421
01:05:45,974 --> 01:05:48,273
Small world?

422
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,848
- Where is he?
- Your father's dead.

423
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,350
- Two days ago.
- How do you know?

424
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,252
- Because I was there.
- Did you kill him?

425
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:03,105
I didn't have to. He did it himself.

426
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:06,928
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

427
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:08,931
That my father's dead?

428
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:13,001
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

429
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:16,878
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.

430
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:21,440
You're lying. Why would he trust you?

431
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,526
Because he knew that I needed
something in return.

432
01:06:24,976 --> 01:06:26,744
And what was that?

433
01:06:26,844 --> 01:06:29,264
To find L'Americain.

434
01:06:29,714 --> 01:06:32,117
- This interview is over.
- Dr. Swann...

435
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:36,286
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.

436
01:06:40,191 --> 01:06:42,792
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

437
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:08,420
- Can I get you something, sir?
- Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

438
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,455
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

439
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:13,559
I'm really starting to love this place.

440
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,228
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

441
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:17,545
Certainly.

442
01:07:17,645 --> 01:07:20,832
If you've come for the car,
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

443
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:24,002
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

444
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:27,139
- Why are you here, Q?
- I just fancied a break, to be honest.

445
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:29,308
I've been a tad stressed
at work recently.

446
01:07:29,608 --> 01:07:32,541
What with C's people crawling all over us
and the fact that M wants my balls

447
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:34,384
- for Christmas decorations.
- Get to the point.

448
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:38,016
The point, 007,
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

449
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:40,986
Dead and buried. And unless
you come back with me right now,

450
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:43,888
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

451
01:07:43,988 --> 01:07:46,491
Do you understand? All hell
is breaking loose out there and...

452
01:07:46,591 --> 01:07:49,590
- I saw him.
- You thought you saw him.

453
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,362
We've been through the records.

454
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:53,865
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

455
01:07:53,965 --> 01:07:57,507
Yes. I know that. But I saw him.

456
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:02,512
He's not someone I'll ever forget.

457
01:08:03,074 --> 01:08:07,178
- So you have a lead?
- I have a name. L'Americain.

458
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:12,450
Well, that narrows it down.
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

459
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,385
My whole career is on the line here.

460
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:18,322
Either you come back in and do this through
proper channels, or I go directly to M.

461
01:08:18,422 --> 01:08:21,927
Do one more thing for me.
Then you're out.

462
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:24,760
Find out what you can from this.

463
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:36,692
- I really, really hate you right now.
- Thank you, Q.

464
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:39,344
Monsieur? Now? Please?

465
01:08:39,444 --> 01:08:41,813
- Where are you staying?
- The Pevsner. Room 12.

466
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:43,979
One hour.

467
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:48,019
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

468
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:51,823
Do me a favor, will you?
Throw that down the toilet.

469
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:53,338
Cut out the middleman.

470
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:04,867
No! Stay.

471
01:09:54,952 --> 01:09:56,986
What do you want?

472
01:09:59,858 --> 01:10:01,890
What are you doing?

473
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:05,294
Can't any of you speak?

474
01:13:30,635 --> 01:13:32,310
Come on!

475
01:14:28,776 --> 01:14:31,662
Right, come on. Come on.

476
01:14:31,762 --> 01:14:34,065
Don't touch me!

477
01:14:34,665 --> 01:14:38,570
Hey! You need to take a breath
and calm down. You're in shock.

478
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,412
Get away from me! Just get away!

479
01:14:41,512 --> 01:14:44,773
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?

480
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:51,215
I haven't got time for this.

481
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:54,552
You need to tell me everything
you know about L'Americain.

482
01:14:54,952 --> 01:14:57,185
Go to hell!

483
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,737
I gave your father my word!

484
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:07,331
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

485
01:15:07,431 --> 01:15:10,032
Because right now, Dr. Swann...

486
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:14,231
I'm your best chance of staying alive.

487
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:41,333
Dr. Swann, Q. Q, Dr. Swann.

488
01:15:41,665 --> 01:15:44,570
- Hello.
- Enchanted.

489
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:48,373
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.

490
01:15:48,473 --> 01:15:50,438
- She knows.
- But, Bond...

491
01:15:50,538 --> 01:15:53,545
She knows. What have you got?

492
01:15:54,145 --> 01:15:56,777
I owe you an apology, 007.

493
01:15:57,147 --> 01:15:59,216
You are onto something.

494
01:15:59,316 --> 01:16:02,584
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.

495
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:06,157
And it seems they were all
part of one organization.

496
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:10,061
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.

497
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:12,263
And do you know who links them all?

498
01:16:12,363 --> 01:16:14,832
- Him.
- Exactly.

499
01:16:14,932 --> 01:16:18,486
This organization,
do you know what it's called?

500
01:16:18,836 --> 01:16:21,531
- No.
- Spectre.

501
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:24,909
Its name is Spectre.

502
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:28,744
- How does she know that?
- Because my father was part of it.

503
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,589
Then I think that you ought to see this.

504
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:34,318
<i>You're looking at pictures
from South Africa right now</i>

505
01:16:34,418 --> 01:16:39,321
- <i>of what appears to be a huge explosion.</i>
- Q, go back to London.

506
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:43,327
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.

507
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:45,062
I will.

508
01:16:45,162 --> 01:16:48,259
And, Bond, you have to find L'Americain.

509
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,434
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

510
01:16:50,534 --> 01:16:52,747
It's not a person.

511
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,430
It's a place.

512
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:01,903
Thank you.

513
01:18:33,203 --> 01:18:36,004
This is where they spent
their wedding night.

514
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:39,441
They came back every year.

515
01:18:39,944 --> 01:18:42,611
Then they brought me with them, too.

516
01:18:45,216 --> 01:18:48,174
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

517
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:53,088
Well, then I'm sorry.

518
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:55,523
What for?

519
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,574
What is it?

520
01:19:13,677 --> 01:19:16,046
It's your inheritance.

521
01:19:16,146 --> 01:19:19,181
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

522
01:19:20,217 --> 01:19:22,668
You don't know what you're missing.

523
01:19:31,529 --> 01:19:33,778
This can't be it.

524
01:19:34,348 --> 01:19:37,256
Well, here's to your father.

525
01:19:37,868 --> 01:19:42,817
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.

526
01:19:43,841 --> 01:19:46,377
I cut off all contact.

527
01:19:46,677 --> 01:19:50,675
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.

528
01:19:51,415 --> 01:19:54,252
And then, with his dying breath...

529
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,751
he sends me you.

530
01:19:57,287 --> 01:20:01,252
- Ironic, no?
- You shouldn't be so hard on him.

531
01:20:01,592 --> 01:20:04,695
The man I just met
should have been dead weeks ago.

532
01:20:04,795 --> 01:20:07,633
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.

533
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,600
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.

534
01:20:12,737 --> 01:20:15,970
And, now, I'm going to bed.

535
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:27,199
Don't think for one moment
this is where I fall into your arms,

536
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:31,643
seeking solace for my dead daddy.

537
01:20:34,825 --> 01:20:38,066
You sit there. Keep watch.

538
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,549
That's what you're good at.

539
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:47,519
Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.

540
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,144
I don't doubt it.

541
01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:03,050
Look. There are two of you.

542
01:21:04,288 --> 01:21:06,721
Two Jameses.

543
01:21:07,358 --> 01:21:09,410
Lucky me.

544
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:09,184
Who sent you?

545
01:22:12,523 --> 01:22:15,260
Who are you working for?

546
01:22:51,995 --> 01:22:54,536
Now, where did you go?

547
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:24,960
Of course.

548
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:49,744
What is it?

549
01:24:51,815 --> 01:24:53,682
Nothing.

550
01:25:07,598 --> 01:25:11,666
- What's this?
- It's coordinates.

551
01:25:14,438 --> 01:25:16,774
Your father was scanning
for a particular satellite phone.

552
01:25:16,874 --> 01:25:19,227
He was looking for someone.

553
01:25:20,877 --> 01:25:23,283
He was looking for him.

554
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:27,032
And he sent me here to finish the job.

555
01:25:28,986 --> 01:25:32,019
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

556
01:25:32,122 --> 01:25:34,958
- I like you alive.
- I can look after myself.

557
01:25:35,058 --> 01:25:37,285
That's beside the point.

558
01:25:38,262 --> 01:25:40,130
I might not be coming back.

559
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,299
I know.

560
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,701
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.

561
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:06,600
So, where was he going?

562
01:26:09,526 --> 01:26:11,559
Nowhere.

563
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,077
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.

564
01:26:26,177 --> 01:26:27,211
What's going on?

565
01:26:27,311 --> 01:26:29,182
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?

566
01:26:29,282 --> 01:26:31,628
- No, we didn't.
- Shortest meeting I can remember.

567
01:26:31,848 --> 01:26:35,619
- South Africans on board, I take it?
- Yeah, well, who can blame them?

568
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:37,855
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

569
01:26:37,955 --> 01:26:40,391
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

570
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:44,328
It's a major step forward. Global
intelligence cooperation changes everything.

571
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:46,861
As you said before.

572
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,963
Look.

573
01:26:50,063 --> 01:26:52,189
They've asked me
to head the new committee.

574
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:54,224
Yes? And?

575
01:26:54,324 --> 01:26:57,828
And I should tell you I've spoken
with the Home Secretary.

576
01:26:57,928 --> 01:27:00,664
And in light of the new information
I've given him,

577
01:27:00,764 --> 01:27:03,867
he's decided to close down
the double-0 program with immediate effect.

578
01:27:04,267 --> 01:27:09,466
- You don't know what you're doing.
- It's not personal. It's the future.

579
01:27:09,566 --> 01:27:11,372
And...

580
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:17,211
- You're not.
- You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?

581
01:27:18,448 --> 01:27:21,983
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- I wouldn't.

582
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,498
This isn't over yet.

583
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:45,669
- Would you press this for me? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

584
01:28:04,861 --> 01:28:06,928
Pick it up.

585
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:08,865
I hate guns.

586
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:11,635
I promised him I'd protect you.

587
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:14,438
The first thing to do is to teach you
how to protect yourself.

588
01:28:14,638 --> 01:28:16,907
What if I shoot you by mistake?

589
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:19,625
Wouldn't be the first time.

590
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:22,945
- Pick it up.
- I said, I hate guns.

591
01:28:28,718 --> 01:28:33,988
SIG 226. Front sight.
Rear sight. Hammer.

592
01:28:38,996 --> 01:28:43,701
You just point it. You squeeze the trigger.
You try not to close your eyes.

593
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,253
Please...

594
01:28:46,353 --> 01:28:48,446
try it.

595
01:29:12,095 --> 01:29:14,763
I don't have to teach you
anything, do I?

596
01:29:16,766 --> 01:29:20,403
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.

597
01:29:20,503 --> 01:29:23,640
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

598
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,943
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter

599
01:29:26,043 --> 01:29:28,807
under the sink with the bleach.

600
01:29:31,715 --> 01:29:33,679
That's why I hate guns.

601
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:37,508
I think we'll skip hand-to-hand combat.

602
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:58,576
Good evening, sir. Sorry to interrupt
your supper, but we have some news.

603
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,143
Evening, sir.

604
01:30:00,243 --> 01:30:05,414
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond
to a point here in North Africa.

605
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,219
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

606
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:13,490
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.

607
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,923
We can't help him.

608
01:30:16,326 --> 01:30:19,059
But, sir, we know where he's heading.

609
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:24,332
C is watching everything we do.
We're only handing them more information.

610
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,939
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

611
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:33,544
- We have to. We only make him weaker.
- But, sir, we know exactly where he is.

612
01:30:33,644 --> 01:30:37,181
Yes, I know, but if we can
track him, so can others.

613
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:40,882
Delete all the Smart Blood files.
Everything.

614
01:30:42,819 --> 01:30:44,917
He's on his own.

615
01:31:10,714 --> 01:31:14,982
- You shouldn't stare.
- Well, you shouldn't look like that.

616
01:31:18,288 --> 01:31:19,923
May I get you an aperitif?

617
01:31:20,023 --> 01:31:24,534
I'm not sure. It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

618
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:26,296
Well, we can't have that.

619
01:31:26,396 --> 01:31:30,034
So, I'll have a vodka martini, dirty.

620
01:31:30,334 --> 01:31:32,782
Make that two.

621
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:38,475
- I have a question.
- Well, what's that?

622
01:31:38,575 --> 01:31:41,711
Why, given every other possible option,

623
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:44,280
does a man choose the life
of a paid assassin?

624
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,228
Well, it was that or the priesthood.

625
01:31:48,385 --> 01:31:51,622
I'm serious.
Is this really what you want?

626
01:31:51,722 --> 01:31:56,059
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?

627
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:59,162
Always looking behind you? Always alone?

628
01:31:59,462 --> 01:32:01,432
But I'm not alone.

629
01:32:01,532 --> 01:32:04,133
Answer the question.

630
01:32:04,434 --> 01:32:06,944
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

631
01:32:08,258 --> 01:32:10,340
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.

632
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,555
What would happen if you did?

633
01:32:13,377 --> 01:32:16,010
- Stop?
- Yes.

634
01:32:19,816 --> 01:32:21,784
I don't know.

635
01:32:21,884 --> 01:32:25,943
- Your drinks, sir.
- Could you leave them there, please?

636
01:32:37,334 --> 01:32:39,736
You know, I think you're wrong.

637
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,869
I am?

638
01:32:42,438 --> 01:32:44,950
We always have a choice.

639
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,444
I'll drink to that.

640
01:35:37,013 --> 01:35:38,912
Shit.

641
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:48,802
What do we do now?

642
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,352
This might be a long wait.

643
01:36:51,904 --> 01:36:54,065
Are you having second thoughts?

644
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:56,857
Too late now.

645
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:17,778
What's that?

646
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:38,158
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce
Silver Wraith.

647
01:38:01,557 --> 01:38:03,390
Please.

648
01:38:25,431 --> 01:38:27,340
I'm scared, James.

649
01:39:11,093 --> 01:39:13,763
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

650
01:39:14,063 --> 01:39:17,833
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

651
01:39:17,933 --> 01:39:20,837
Well... it's a pleasure to be here.

652
01:39:20,937 --> 01:39:23,222
Your host invites you both to rest,

653
01:39:23,322 --> 01:39:26,226
relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.

654
01:39:26,376 --> 01:39:28,545
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.

655
01:39:28,645 --> 01:39:32,713
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.

656
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:45,017
You be careful with that.

657
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:47,949
It's loaded.

658
01:39:53,803 --> 01:39:55,836
Thank you.

659
01:40:54,497 --> 01:40:57,068
This is a very special place.

660
01:40:57,168 --> 01:41:00,883
He has requested you enter it alone.

661
01:41:00,983 --> 01:41:03,103
Of course.

662
01:41:04,807 --> 01:41:06,840
Champagne?

663
01:41:07,476 --> 01:41:09,479
Maybe later.

664
01:41:09,579 --> 01:41:11,412
Certainly.

665
01:41:42,444 --> 01:41:44,949
I think we're meant to be impressed.

666
01:41:57,893 --> 01:41:59,960
Touch it.

667
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:03,354
You can touch it if you want.

668
01:42:05,234 --> 01:42:09,269
- Do you know what it is?
- It's a meteorite.

669
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:12,141
Yes, exactly.

670
01:42:12,241 --> 01:42:16,210
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

671
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:20,914
The very meteorite
which made this crater.

672
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:23,463
Think about it.

673
01:42:23,563 --> 01:42:28,224
So many years up there, alone, silent,

674
01:42:28,324 --> 01:42:33,139
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.

675
01:42:34,062 --> 01:42:36,811
A huge, unstoppable force.

676
01:42:37,311 --> 01:42:40,169
Except it did stop, didn't it?

677
01:42:40,269 --> 01:42:42,423
Right here.

678
01:42:56,218 --> 01:42:59,955
I can't tell you how much
I've been looking forward to this.

679
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:02,823
All of us here, together.

680
01:43:05,027 --> 01:43:06,584
A reunion.

681
01:43:08,764 --> 01:43:12,310
I'm so glad you came, too,
dear Madeleine.

682
01:43:13,369 --> 01:43:16,904
You were just a girl
when I saw you first.

683
01:43:17,573 --> 01:43:20,625
I came to your home once
to see your father.

684
01:43:23,112 --> 01:43:24,831
I don't remember that.

685
01:43:26,048 --> 01:43:28,147
But I do.

686
01:43:32,038 --> 01:43:33,341
Shall we?

687
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,191
- What is this place?
- Information.

688
01:43:43,966 --> 01:43:46,553
Information is all...

689
01:43:47,203 --> 01:43:49,236
is it not?

690
01:43:49,572 --> 01:43:56,520
For example, you must know by now that
the double-0 program is officially dead.

691
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:00,814
Which leads me to speculate
exactly why you came.

692
01:44:03,419 --> 01:44:06,281
So, James, why did you come?

693
01:44:06,839 --> 01:44:08,493
I came here to kill you.

694
01:44:09,592 --> 01:44:11,861
And I thought you came here to die.

695
01:44:12,161 --> 01:44:15,273
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

696
01:44:15,798 --> 01:44:17,758
Speaking of perspective.

697
01:44:35,518 --> 01:44:39,646
- Is this live?
- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

698
01:44:40,222 --> 01:44:42,358
What an uncanny coincidence.

699
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:46,763
<i>The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."</i>

700
01:44:47,063 --> 01:44:51,100
<i>Well, maybe it's the fate of spies
to just disappear.</i>

701
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:55,638
<i>But with any luck,
we leave something behind.</i>

702
01:44:55,738 --> 01:44:59,748
<i>In the meantime, I'm sure
C will keep you all busy.</i>

703
01:44:59,848 --> 01:45:02,392
<i>Thank you all.</i>

704
01:45:05,314 --> 01:45:09,249
That's touching, don't you think?

705
01:45:11,321 --> 01:45:13,723
Well, James...

706
01:45:13,823 --> 01:45:15,958
it looks like you're all alone.

707
01:45:16,058 --> 01:45:19,259
Not much more than a voyeur, are you?

708
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:22,064
Too scared to join in.

709
01:45:22,164 --> 01:45:25,234
- I don't think you quite understand.
- Oh, I think I do.

710
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:28,070
You set cities on fire and watch
innocent people burn,

711
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:33,175
so you can convince governments to join
an intelligence network you've paid for.

712
01:45:33,275 --> 01:45:35,611
Not that complicated.

713
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:40,113
I'm guessing our little friend, C,
he's one of your disciples.

714
01:45:40,949 --> 01:45:44,452
- You could say that.
- And what does he get out of it?

715
01:45:45,354 --> 01:45:47,189
Nothing.

716
01:45:47,289 --> 01:45:49,091
He's a visionary, like me.

717
01:45:49,191 --> 01:45:51,527
Visionaries.

718
01:45:51,627 --> 01:45:53,459
Psychiatric wards are full of them.

719
01:45:53,559 --> 01:45:56,432
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

720
01:45:56,532 --> 01:46:01,103
You came across me so many times
and yet you never saw me.

721
01:46:01,203 --> 01:46:03,505
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

722
01:46:03,605 --> 01:46:06,258
- All dead.
- Yeah, that's right.

723
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:12,112
A nice pattern developed. You interfered
in my world, I destroyed yours.

724
01:46:13,182 --> 01:46:17,355
Or did you think it was coincidence that
all the women in your life ended up dead?

725
01:46:18,688 --> 01:46:21,793
Vesper Lynd, for example.

726
01:46:22,324 --> 01:46:25,826
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?

727
01:46:28,064 --> 01:46:32,034
And then, of course, your beloved M.

728
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:34,901
Gone forever.

729
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,207
Me.

730
01:46:41,376 --> 01:46:44,937
It was all me, James.
It's always been me.

731
01:46:45,037 --> 01:46:48,282
The author of all your pain.

732
01:46:51,086 --> 01:46:54,150
You're a brave woman, my dear.

733
01:47:00,829 --> 01:47:04,259
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

734
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:07,219
He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.

735
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:09,521
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

736
01:47:09,671 --> 01:47:12,911
You see, they failed
to comprehend the crucial fact,

737
01:47:13,011 --> 01:47:17,477
that a terrible event can lead
to something wonderful.

738
01:47:19,115 --> 01:47:22,017
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.

739
01:47:22,117 --> 01:47:26,753
<i>She's clever. She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.</i>

740
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:31,224
<i>I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.</i>

741
01:47:33,562 --> 01:47:36,398
- <i>I can keep her alive.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

742
01:47:36,498 --> 01:47:39,635
- <i>You have my word.</i>
- No, no, no. Turn this off.

743
01:47:39,735 --> 01:47:42,037
<i>Your word?</i>

744
01:47:42,137 --> 01:47:44,900
- <i>The word of an assassin!</i>
- Turn this off.

745
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,607
- This is important.
- I said turn it off!

746
01:47:49,645 --> 01:47:52,242
I want you to understand something.

747
01:48:02,157 --> 01:48:03,787
<i>That's my word.</i>

748
01:48:04,994 --> 01:48:08,092
Madeleine? Look at me.

749
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:13,361
Don't look at him, Madeleine.
Look at me.

750
01:48:14,503 --> 01:48:16,801
<i>L'Americain.</i>

751
01:48:17,339 --> 01:48:19,141
<i>You save her,</i>

752
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:22,243
<i>she can lead you to L'Americain.
She knows L'Americain.</i>

753
01:48:25,013 --> 01:48:27,830
<i>Try the Hoffler Klinik.</i>

754
01:48:33,589 --> 01:48:38,609
<i>You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.</i>

755
01:48:41,096 --> 01:48:43,329
<i>So long.</i>

756
01:48:49,705 --> 01:48:53,378
The things that bring people together.

757
01:48:56,879 --> 01:49:00,467
Out of horror, beauty.

758
01:49:26,274 --> 01:49:28,978
Torture is easy, on a superficial level.

759
01:49:29,078 --> 01:49:32,581
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled and...

760
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:35,651
derive great horror from the experience,

761
01:49:35,751 --> 01:49:38,453
but it's still going on at a distance.

762
01:49:38,553 --> 01:49:41,724
It isn't taking place where he is.

763
01:49:42,124 --> 01:49:48,163
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.

764
01:49:48,263 --> 01:49:51,965
That's where the seat of his soul is.

765
01:49:52,401 --> 01:49:58,340
Now, James and I were both present recently
when a man was deprived of his eyes.

766
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:02,978
And the most astonishing thing happened.
Didn't you notice?

767
01:50:03,578 --> 01:50:05,914
He wasn't there anymore.

768
01:50:06,014 --> 01:50:08,251
He'd gone even though
he was still alive.

769
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:12,421
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

770
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:15,956
there was nobody inside his skull.

771
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:19,025
Most odd.

772
01:50:20,161 --> 01:50:21,440
So, James.

773
01:50:23,365 --> 01:50:26,569
I'm going to penetrate...

774
01:50:27,069 --> 01:50:29,938
to where you are.

775
01:50:30,038 --> 01:50:32,373
To the inside of your head.

776
01:50:33,342 --> 01:50:36,579
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,

777
01:50:36,679 --> 01:50:40,449
your hearing and your balance,

778
01:50:40,549 --> 01:50:43,451
just with the subtlest of manipulations.

779
01:50:43,551 --> 01:50:46,188
Well, get on with it then.

780
01:50:46,288 --> 01:50:50,225
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

781
01:50:50,325 --> 01:50:52,461
All right.

782
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:53,908
Let's begin.

783
01:51:26,628 --> 01:51:29,162
Why are you doing this?

784
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:46,846
You probably know that James here
lost his parents when he was young.

785
01:51:49,285 --> 01:51:51,820
But did you know that it was my father

786
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,287
who helped him
through this difficult time?

787
01:52:02,597 --> 01:52:06,536
Over the course of two winters
he taught him to ski,

788
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:09,471
and climb, and hunt.

789
01:52:09,571 --> 01:52:14,374
He soothed the wounds
of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

790
01:52:16,645 --> 01:52:19,915
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

791
01:52:20,015 --> 01:52:22,448
My little brother.

792
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:26,152
They formed quite an attachment.

793
01:52:26,922 --> 01:52:28,758
So...

794
01:52:28,858 --> 01:52:30,990
you killed him.

795
01:52:31,493 --> 01:52:33,633
Yes, I did.

796
01:52:36,598 --> 01:52:42,207
You know what happens when a cuckoo
hatches inside another bird's nest?

797
01:52:43,438 --> 01:52:45,305
Yes.

798
01:52:45,773 --> 01:52:48,177
It forces the other eggs out.

799
01:52:48,277 --> 01:52:50,715
Yes. Well...

800
01:52:50,815 --> 01:52:54,968
this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

801
01:52:55,851 --> 01:52:58,507
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

802
01:52:58,607 --> 01:53:01,955
So, thank you. Cuckoo.

803
01:53:07,145 --> 01:53:10,347
Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?

804
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:19,972
Hello, pussy.

805
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:25,339
Franz Oberhauser died
20 years ago, James.

806
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,284
In an avalanche, alongside his father.

807
01:53:29,384 --> 01:53:33,856
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,

808
01:53:34,556 --> 01:53:37,073
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

809
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,221
Catchy name.

810
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:42,170
My mother's bloodline.

811
01:53:42,998 --> 01:53:47,736
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the fusiform gyrus,

812
01:53:47,836 --> 01:53:49,971
you'll recognize no one.

813
01:53:50,071 --> 01:53:54,392
Of course, the faces of your women
are interchangeable, aren't they, James?

814
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:57,312
You won't know who she is.

815
01:53:57,412 --> 01:54:01,747
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

816
01:54:09,358 --> 01:54:12,142
He dies not knowing who you are.

817
01:54:14,363 --> 01:54:16,765
The daughter of an assassin.

818
01:54:16,865 --> 01:54:19,934
The only one who could have
understood him.

819
01:54:20,034 --> 01:54:21,480
Shame.

820
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,687
I love you.

821
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:08,541
Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

822
01:55:12,087 --> 01:55:14,756
I'd recognize you anywhere.

823
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:19,258
The watch.

824
01:55:33,842 --> 01:55:35,943
One minute.

825
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:39,182
One minute.

826
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:45,552
- Did he say something?
- Tempus fugit.

827
01:55:47,088 --> 01:55:50,358
- What?
- Tempus fugit.

828
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:52,880
I can't hear you, James.

829
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,765
I said...

830
01:55:56,865 --> 01:55:59,398
doesn't time fly?

831
01:56:26,044 --> 01:56:28,148
In there!

832
01:57:09,037 --> 01:57:11,194
Let's go home.

833
01:57:26,621 --> 01:57:28,988
It's not over yet.

834
01:58:18,206 --> 01:58:22,671
- I've never even heard of Hildebrand.
- That is the general idea with safe houses.

835
01:58:40,061 --> 01:58:43,630
- Exactly how safe is this, sir?
- We're about to find out.

836
01:58:47,069 --> 01:58:50,514
It's safe. Better wait here.

837
01:58:53,642 --> 01:58:55,777
- I'm M.
- Madeleine Swann.

838
01:58:55,877 --> 01:58:58,846
Pleased to meet you.
So, what do you have for me, 007?

839
01:58:58,946 --> 01:59:03,652
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

840
01:59:03,752 --> 01:59:08,387
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

841
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:13,100
About to take control of his very own
global surveillance system that he built

842
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,562
right here under our noses.

843
01:59:14,662 --> 01:59:17,099
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.

844
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:20,365
If that happens, Spectre
will have control of everything.

845
01:59:20,465 --> 01:59:23,690
So, you and I will have a quiet word
with C while Q hacks into the system

846
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:26,674
- and stops it going online.
- It won't be easy.

847
01:59:26,774 --> 01:59:30,276
He'll find a way. He always does.

848
01:59:34,082 --> 01:59:36,718
It's good to have you back, 007.

849
01:59:36,818 --> 01:59:38,617
Sir.

850
01:59:47,429 --> 01:59:49,898
James, I can't.

851
01:59:50,098 --> 01:59:53,833
I'll come back for you
when it's all over.

852
01:59:53,935 --> 01:59:55,537
No, I can't.

853
01:59:55,837 --> 01:59:58,480
No, you can't stay here, or you...

854
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:03,511
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.

855
02:00:03,611 --> 02:00:05,152
This is who you are.

856
02:00:07,749 --> 02:00:10,018
You're saying good-bye.

857
02:00:10,118 --> 02:00:11,947
Yes.

858
02:00:13,437 --> 02:00:15,671
Take care.

859
02:00:17,358 --> 02:00:19,194
You're a good man, James.

860
02:01:20,421 --> 02:01:22,157
Are you in yet, Q?

861
02:01:22,257 --> 02:01:26,747
A few layers of impenetrable security still
to go, but I think I'm getting somewhere.

862
02:02:15,243 --> 02:02:17,860
They've seen us! Reverse!

863
02:02:56,618 --> 02:02:57,884
Go!

864
02:03:08,929 --> 02:03:10,798
Get him in the building!

865
02:03:10,898 --> 02:03:13,128
Move. Move!

866
02:04:32,013 --> 02:04:36,172
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

867
02:04:45,226 --> 02:04:48,049
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?

868
02:04:52,667 --> 02:04:57,305
- Don't tell me you're responsible for this.
- No, but my Quartermaster is.

869
02:04:57,405 --> 02:05:00,608
- And he's extremely talented.
- Well, bravo.

870
02:05:00,708 --> 02:05:04,380
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.

871
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:06,213
So you're trespassing.

872
02:05:06,313 --> 02:05:08,816
I'm afraid you've got the wrong end
of the stick, Max.

873
02:05:08,916 --> 02:05:11,652
We're going to stop
this system going online.

874
02:05:11,752 --> 02:05:14,889
- And then I'm going to bring you in.
- On what grounds exactly?

875
02:05:14,989 --> 02:05:17,123
Poor taste in friends.

876
02:05:53,127 --> 02:05:55,679
Take a look at the world.

877
02:05:57,232 --> 02:05:59,098
Chaos.

878
02:05:59,434 --> 02:06:03,070
Because people like you,
paper-pushers and politicians,

879
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:06,674
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.

880
02:06:06,974 --> 02:06:10,545
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

881
02:06:10,645 --> 02:06:15,843
And now you want to throw it away
for the sake of "democracy."

882
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:17,952
Whatever the hell that is.

883
02:06:18,352 --> 02:06:20,975
How predictably moronic.

884
02:06:21,075 --> 02:06:24,657
But then isn't that what M stands for?

885
02:06:26,327 --> 02:06:28,361
"Moron."

886
02:06:29,463 --> 02:06:32,898
And now we know what C stands for.

887
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:37,749
"Careless."

888
02:07:17,095 --> 02:07:18,763
Come on.

889
02:07:19,213 --> 02:07:21,546
No, no, no!

890
02:08:24,852 --> 02:08:27,851
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

891
02:08:37,191 --> 02:08:40,128
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.

892
02:08:40,228 --> 02:08:42,637
My wounds will heal.

893
02:08:43,898 --> 02:08:45,483
What about yours?

894
02:08:47,068 --> 02:08:49,437
Look around you, James. Look.

895
02:08:49,537 --> 02:08:52,106
This is what's left of your world.

896
02:08:52,206 --> 02:08:56,449
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.

897
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:00,080
Why are we here?

898
02:09:01,549 --> 02:09:03,222
Did you miss me?

899
02:09:04,052 --> 02:09:05,851
No.

900
02:09:11,992 --> 02:09:14,687
But I know someone who does.

901
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:24,415
Where is she?

902
02:09:25,139 --> 02:09:27,733
That's for you to find out.

903
02:09:35,082 --> 02:09:39,001
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.

904
02:09:39,186 --> 02:09:43,557
I can get out easily.
Now, you have a choice.

905
02:09:43,657 --> 02:09:46,194
Die trying to save her or...

906
02:09:46,294 --> 02:09:49,631
save yourself and live with the pain.

907
02:09:49,731 --> 02:09:51,763
You're bluffing.

908
02:09:53,534 --> 02:09:55,400
Am I?

909
02:10:02,226 --> 02:10:05,392
I've really put you
through it, haven't I?

910
02:10:05,913 --> 02:10:08,249
That's brothers for you.

911
02:10:08,349 --> 02:10:11,488
They always know which buttons to press.

912
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:26,353
Madeleine!

913
02:10:31,606 --> 02:10:33,340
Come on.

914
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:35,387
Come on.

915
02:10:36,076 --> 02:10:38,009
Yes!

916
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:42,536
Let's go. After you.

917
02:10:52,793 --> 02:10:55,559
Why can't you just face it, M?

918
02:10:57,231 --> 02:10:59,400
You don't matter anymore.

919
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:02,855
Maybe I don't. But something has to.

920
02:11:57,925 --> 02:11:59,885
- Dead.
- Any word on Bond?

921
02:11:59,985 --> 02:12:02,389
No. But I can hazard a guess.

922
02:12:10,171 --> 02:12:12,193
Madeleine!

923
02:12:14,375 --> 02:12:16,404
Madeleine!

924
02:13:01,289 --> 02:13:03,857
- Do you trust me?
- Do I have a choice?

925
02:13:03,957 --> 02:13:05,990
Not anymore.

926
02:13:15,836 --> 02:13:17,269
Come on!

927
02:13:32,052 --> 02:13:34,081
Good-bye, James Bond.

928
02:15:36,711 --> 02:15:38,502
Brace, brace, brace!

929
02:16:46,013 --> 02:16:49,714
- Sir, this is a terrorist alert.
- Mallory, double-0 section.

930
02:16:51,786 --> 02:16:53,953
Stand them down.

931
02:16:55,255 --> 02:16:58,625
- Echo team, hold fire.
- Stand down.

932
02:17:35,011 --> 02:17:36,145
Finish it.

933
02:17:47,641 --> 02:17:49,329
Finish it.

934
02:18:01,789 --> 02:18:03,755
Out of bullets.

935
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:22,316
And besides...

936
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:24,643
I've got something better to do.

937
02:19:10,991 --> 02:19:13,060
Under the Special Measures Act of 2001,

938
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:16,211
I am detaining you on behalf
of Her Majesty's Government.

939
02:20:22,362 --> 02:20:23,670
Bond?

940
02:20:28,835 --> 02:20:31,871
- What are you doing here?
- Good morning, Q.

941
02:20:38,595 --> 02:20:41,066
- I thought you'd gone.
- I have.

942
02:20:42,850 --> 02:20:45,234
There's just one thing I need.
