2
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,330
it is okay, son...

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,481
I know you want this to be over.

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,128
I am right here.

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,171
I will be right here...

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,081
But, you do not give up.

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,050
You hear me?

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,926
As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,967
You breathe... keep breathing.

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,851
Hawk.

11
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,082
Ah,  .

12
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,571
  sumbitches.

13
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,405
The sumbitch got   for brains.

14
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,921
You seen Coulter?

15
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
Nope.

16
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,371
Listen up!

17
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,020
When them plews is cleaned,

18
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,248
I want you to hoop them up real tight.

19
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,460
Remember, we are not doing
no 15-pelt bales!

20
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,500
we are going 30-pelt bales!

21
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,601
Fitzgerald!

22
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,620
Cap'n.

23
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,644
Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?

24
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,820
I am thinking, whatever it is
they are hunting out there...

25
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,843
I hope it do not need another shot.

26
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,060
Make sure we are ready to head out by dawn.

27
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,180
Been done by this morning.

28
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,860
I would have liked to be out by how,
but the men are too tired.

29
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,300
we are only a few days from the fort.

30
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,420
we are trapped out.

31
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,922
All we have to worry about
is fresh meat for the boys.

32
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,820
Well, you, a, seen Coulter?

33
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,644
Hey, we took down an elk. A big one.

34
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,449
We need help to haul the meat back.

35
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,020
Let me know when it is on the spit.

36
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,380
I will help you with it then.

37
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,220
Come on, I need your help.

38
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,641
We needed help when we were
loading them bales.

39
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,645
I been eating this  
  meat so long...

40
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,928
I am starting to miss my wife's cooking.

41
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,660
I am starting to miss your wife.

42
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,807
Shut up.

43
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,321
Help!

44
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,491
Help.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,331
Is that Coulter?

46
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,802
You go get the Captain.

47
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,291
Jesus Christ.

48
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,169
Anybody see them?

49
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,811
Stay quiet.

50
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,166
Watch the ridge.

51
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,208
What was that?

52
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,007
dad?

53
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
let us go.

54
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,724
They got Thomas.

55
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,565
I cannot see them. I cannot see them.

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,085
Get down!

57
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,086
we are surrounded! they are everywhere!

58
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,089
Stay here! Stay here!

59
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,605
Paul, no!

60
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,402
They want us out in the open.

61
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,760
Nobody move! Stay where you are!

62
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,780
They want the pelts.

63
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,130
We got to get on that boat
right now or we will lose it all.

64
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,282
Get to the boat! To the boat, son! Move!

65
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,251
Move, move!

66
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,126
Leave the furs!
Leave the furs! To the boat!

67
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,442
Hawk!

68
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,965
Hawk!

69
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,970
Hawk!

70
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,522
Grab some pelts! Come on, grab the pelts!

71
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,566
Grab the pelts! Grab the pelts!

72
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,409
Give this to my little girl.

73
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,762
you are coming with us. I will get help.

74
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,605
Leave the furs! Leave the pelts!

75
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,566
Willman!

76
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,820
Lean on me. Just keep going.

77
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,602
Get to the boat!

78
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,085
  savage!

79
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,641
Get on the   boat!

80
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,611
Help!

81
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,007
Cut the rope! Cut the rope!

82
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,810
Wait for Amos!

83
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,490
No! We go now!

84
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,649
Fire the cannon!

85
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,526
do not leave! Wait!

86
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,761
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

87
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,449
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

88
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,169
we will trade pelts with the French
for horses and keep searching for her.

89
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,204
...and dust becomes flour
and when the morning is clear...

90
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,570
this child of   will meet
Jesus Christ himself. Amen.

91
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,761
You ready?

92
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,091
Hold still.

93
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,930
Where did you learn that?

94
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,121
My father was a doctor. Bridger!

95
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,604
Captain, we got a swarm of tree  
out here waiting to finish the job.

96
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,406
Tell me you got some kind of plan.

97
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,601
Glass?

98
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,802
Missouri's no good.

99
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,601
Not while the Ree's running it.

100
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,610
We got to get off this boat.

101
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,802
Oh, you want to get off the boat?

102
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,129
Then what do we do, ha?

103
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,490
Take our furs and sit out there amongst
the Ree like a bunch of ducks?

104
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,963
Only safe thing to do is track
a new course back up on land.

105
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,491
Thatoll add weeks to the trip.

106
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,682
Better than floating
where they can get eyes on us.

107
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,327
They got eyes on you right now, son.

108
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,484
What I am saying is we stay on the boat.

109
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,460
Chart a course toward the fort
and take our chances on the water.

110
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,500
Glass knows this territory best.

111
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,170
it is his job to get us home safe.

112
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,380
- Get us home safe?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,900
Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?

114
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,180
it is 33 now. They were my men, Fitzgerald.

115
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,123
I know how many I lost.

116
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,651
We do like Glass says.
that is the end of it.

117
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,540
We have to set the boat loose.

118
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,166
If the Ree are tracking us,
they will find it downriver.

119
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,060
Best course is to hike inland to
the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.

120
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,020
On foot?

121
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,300
it will be winter before we get there.

122
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,220
Yeah, unless we come across a post,
trade for some horses.

123
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,163
am not no posts that far over!

124
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,563
Captain, losing this boat
is a   mistake.

125
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,002
The Ree am not that  .

126
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,580
We keep it, we can lay it up
around Arrow's Peak.

127
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,740
Quit acting like you know
what you are talking about.

128
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,330
am not nobody talking to you.

129
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,011
Whofd listen to you anyway?

130
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,420
cannot find your way
out of your breeches to take a  .

131
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,842
All I am saying is Camp Rhulen
is just up the way.

132
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,924
We can hole up there.

133
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,850
We walk.

134
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,522
Yeah, I am sure we will.

135
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,300
Wish my dad was a doctor.

136
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,846
Then he could have bought me
a captaings job.

137
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,260
What do we do, eh?

138
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,523
Pray these pelts am not rotten
if we ever get back here?

139
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,260
Make sure to mark this place.

140
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,886
we are leaving a fortune under these rocks.

141
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,420
Glass, chart a course.

142
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,966
Tightest you can that
gets us around the Ree.

143
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,370
This am not right.

144
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,460
We all know these furs am not going to
be here by the time we come back.

145
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,100
there is no way we can haul them
all the way to the fort.

146
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,123
Arikara are all through the territory.

147
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,460
we will want our hands free.

148
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,460
we are going to lose those pelts.

149
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,085
You rather keep the pelts or your life?

150
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,406
Life?

151
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,405
What life you talking about?
I am not got no life.

152
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,329
I just got living and the only way
I get that is through these pelts.

153
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,006
 !

154
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,300
am not no way I am going home
after six months

155
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,243
working my   off like a mule...

156
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,980
risking my neck, men dying, and for what?

157
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,580
  near lost everything.

158
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,921
Job's been   from the start!

159
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,922
there is the one been   us.

160
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,603
You wonder how the Ree
got the dead drop on us...

161
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,963
when Mr. Glass was supposed
to look out for that very thing?

162
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,340
All them Pawnee buddies of his.

163
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,260
Pawnee's as much against
the Ree as the rest of us.

164
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,441
Yeah?

165
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,606
Well, what about
his little half-breed son?

166
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,420
What kind of savage
you think his mamom was?

167
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,363
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.

168
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,804
All I am saying is...

169
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,805
a savage... is savage.

170
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,210
Hey, Glass...

171
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,180
is it true what they say
about you shooting a lieutenant

172
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,487
while living with them savages?

173
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,020
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.

174
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,327
But you and your boy
the only ones to walk out alive.

175
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,500
Kind of a miracle.

176
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,965
Shut up, Fitzgerald.

177
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,140
Is that what you did?

178
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,641
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,286
Shut up!

180
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,723
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mamom, ha?

181
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,490
Did he   her?

182
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,165
Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle
when I am talking to you.

183
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,900
I am working on it.

184
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
You can work on it
when I am done talking to you.

185
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,900
Look at me.

186
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,331
that is enough!

187
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,761
you are forgetting your place, boy.

188
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,420
As far as I can tell, my place is here
on the smart end of this rifle.

189
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,682
You move along, Fitzgerald.

190
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,740
that is an order!

191
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,860
Listen!

192
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,740
there is only a couple hours of light left.

193
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,020
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.

194
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,360
let us go!

195
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,900
I told you to be invisible, son.

196
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,220
At least he...

197
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,220
If you want to survive,
keep your mouth shut.

198
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,460
- At least he heard me...
- They do not hear your voice!

199
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,940
They just see the color of your face.

200
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,620
You understand?

201
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,846
Yes.

202
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,980
You have to listen to me, son.

203
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,447
You have to listen.

204
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,005
Beckett!

205
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,161
Weston!

206
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,243
Why are they not jumping?

207
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,241
It looks like they changed their minds.

208
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,242
Smart sumbitches.

209
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,251
Smart.

210
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,921
I ought to be on that boat.

211
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,442
They did the right thing.

212
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,770
it is time to move.

213
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,965
Get up.

214
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,126
we are headed out.

215
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,564
I am coming.

216
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,442
it is better you lay down.

217
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,420
When the rest of the men are ready
you send them to me.

218
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,488
I am going west.

219
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,802
You are my son.

220
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,060
There are only two here.

221
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,140
Powaqa is not here.

222
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,940
The others probably took her.

223
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,883
They went north.

224
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,366
we will pick up their tracks
on the mountain.

225
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,050
Was it the right decision?

226
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,491
Leaving the boat?

227
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,007
The Ree own that river.
They would have flanked us.

228
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,740
We stay east of the Grand through
the mountains, we cut a week off our trip.

229
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,889
Lands are   dry up there.
Nothing for the Ree to hunt.

230
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,325
Except us.

231
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,205
Except us.

232
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,002
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

233
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,205
Is that why you came out here
to the edge of the world?

234
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,140
Glass?

235
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,083
I do like the quiet.

236
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,531
Your boy...

237
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,524
he is seen a lot.

238
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,044
He got a mother
you need to get him back to?

239
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,768
Mr. Glass!

240
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,924
There are cubs here!

241
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,170
We got cubs here!

242
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,804
Christ Almighty.

243
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,645
he is down here!

244
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,489
Keep your eyes open. there is bears around.

245
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,529
I need your help now!

246
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,285
Oh, my  .

247
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,220
Get me rags now!

248
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,005
Give me rags before he bleeds out. Rags.

249
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,844
Prepare the kit. Bridger! You hold that.

250
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,260
Easy. Oh, my  .

251
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,940
Got to give him credit for taking
that grizz down with him.

252
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,260
He should not have shot.

253
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,362
The place is crawling with tree  .

254
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,780
that is enough! that is enough!

255
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,780
we are still in Ree territory.

256
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,620
he is one of our own men.

257
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,780
Scout a circle around us. North and west.

258
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,580
Take those two with you.

259
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,460
Bill, Fryman, you take south and east.

260
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,086
Watch for anyone
that might have heard that shot.

261
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,249
We have to stitch him up.

262
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,300
What about me? Captain?

263
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,890
You just stay here.

264
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,321
Hold it down.

265
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,767
I am so sorry, Mr. Glass.

266
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,486
Bridger, press down here.

267
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,084
he is bleeding down here, too.

268
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,780
they are torturing the  .

269
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,929
The proper thing to do would be
to finish him off quick.

270
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,931
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.

271
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,564
Pulling through?

272
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,882
You saw what that grizz did to him.

273
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,048
- he shall be dead inside an hour.
- Mmm-hmm.

274
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,927
Yeah, we all will be if he do not quit
wailing like that.

275
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,980
Toward you and twist it into place.
I will hold him. Go.

276
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,844
- dad.
- Hold him. Go.

277
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,127
Go!

278
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,686
Now!

279
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,410
He passed out.

280
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,925
I will take advantage
and stitch up his neck.

281
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,127
Water.

282
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,286
Bridger, tell the others
we will camp here tonight.

283
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,727
I am right here.

284
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,883
I will be right here...

285
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,924
Toussaint, he is here.

286
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,046
I thought he would not make it.

287
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,764
I am glad you made it here.

288
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,130
We need horses and rifles.

289
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,842
We bring you many pelts.

290
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,483
No horses... just what we agreed.

291
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,527
Take all the pelts you want.

292
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,810
We need horses and rifles.

293
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,100
I need a woman with big  ...

294
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,884
Who can cook.

295
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,841
We cannot give you any horses.

296
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,940
what is he saying?

297
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,780
I do not know, something about horses.

298
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,008
Bring us something to drink...
some whisky.

299
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,681
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

300
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,525
Always good doing business with you.

301
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,365
Horses.

302
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,041
No horses.

303
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,929
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

304
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,441
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

305
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,243
Where did you get these? The Americans?

306
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,405
they are already branded.

307
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,726
I will only be able
to get half price for them.

308
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,768
Get him away from there.

309
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,370
I said no horses.

310
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,128
we will take these three horses.

311
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,970
I am not going to say it again.

312
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,580
They are not part of the deal.

313
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,364
Now tell your man to step away.

314
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,290
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.

315
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,091
You stand there
and talk to me about honor?

316
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,404
I told you he speaks French.

317
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,002
Those pelts are stolen.

318
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,761
You all have stolen everything from us.

319
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,650
Everything!

320
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,365
The land.

321
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,808
The animals.

322
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,406
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

323
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,700
We leave you these pelts
because honor demands it.

324
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,900
I take your horses to find my daughter.

325
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,800
You are free to try and stop me.

326
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,002
Business is business.

327
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,962
Prepare five horses for them.

328
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,724
I want everybody up at the   of dawn.

329
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,562
Carrying Glass will be hard...

330
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,724
so we need to get ahead
as far as possible.

331
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,563
we will divide into two groups.

332
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,651
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman,

333
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,060
you take the east side of the river.

334
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,561
Anderson, you scout up front.

335
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,001
That claw do not belong to you.

336
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,170
It am not for me.

337
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,565
Stop!

338
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,247
do not let him down! do not let him down!

339
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,131
Watch it.

340
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,126
- How we going to make it up this?
- Slow down.

341
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,811
it is killing us, Captain!

342
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,603
Lift it, Bridger!

343
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,340
  it, keep it steady.

344
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,460
Lift it up higher.

345
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,607
I am.

346
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,940
And heave!

347
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,362
I will go up and pull.

348
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,740
My foot!

349
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,524
Enough of this  !

350
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,291
we will never make it across
like this, Captain.

351
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,300
he is burning up.

352
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,300
Cap'n, you am not doing us
nor him no favors...

353
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,846
by letting him go on suffering like this.

354
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,140
Captain, it is all the same up here.

355
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,700
we are going to have to go back.
Find another way.

356
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,401
Glass. Hugh.

357
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,927
I am sorry. I am sorry.

358
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,921
Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger.

359
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,180
What?

360
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,660
- Lay the rag over his eyes.
- Wait!

361
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,900
I am sorry, Hugh.

362
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,740
Sir, I cannot do that.

363
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,251
How do we get back without him?

364
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,940
Only he knows the way.

365
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,167
- Lay the rag over his eyes.
- I cannot.

366
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,740
Wait! How do we get back...

367
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,603
Lay it over his eyes!

368
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,610
Step back.

369
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,340
Bridger, stop! Bridger, Henry.

370
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,283
Henry! Henry, please.

371
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,285
Captain. Captain. Please. Please leave...

372
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,860
there is a $70 bonus from the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company to the two men...

373
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,180
that stay with Glass to see this through.

374
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,380
I will stay!

375
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,642
Me, too. Money or not, I will stay.

376
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,325
I will need a third.

377
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,780
Sorry, Captain.

378
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,168
I have a family. I am not crazy.

379
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,700
Captain, three men
cannot hold off a party of Ree,

380
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,643
much less some boys.

381
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,060
Besides, $70 am not going to buy
nobody a new set of ears.

382
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,730
A hundred, then.

383
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,540
This man is the only reason
we are still alive.

384
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,900
We were 45 men when this started.

385
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,082
Now we are ten. Almost nine.

386
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,300
he is my father. He can have my share.

387
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,926
Mine, too. He can have my share also.

388
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,920
All right.

389
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,580
If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,
I will lag behind with them.

390
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,900
- You?
- Yep.

391
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,860
You already lost my share of the pelts
so I got no choice but to make it up

392
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,530
by some other means.

393
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,100
Sticking around for another day or two
do not make no difference.

394
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,660
$300... at least I get to
go home with something.

395
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,684
Glass is to be cared
for until, understood?

396
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,691
Yeah. You have my word. I understand.

397
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,683
You boys get him down off this slope
and somewhere safe before dark.

398
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,371
Fitzgerald.

399
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,366
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

400
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,620
And a proper burial when it is time.

401
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,881
he is earned it.

402
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,131
I understand.

403
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,890
You hurt yourself?

404
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,051
I will be fine.

405
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,971
Can you hear that wind, father?

406
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,284
Remember what mother used to say
about the wind?

407
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,805
The wind can not defeat
a tree with strong roots.

408
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,684
You are still breathing...

409
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,729
I miss her so much.

410
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,931
I will be right here...

411
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,488
I am right here.

412
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,920
As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.

413
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,800
You breathe. Keep breathing.

414
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,842
When there is a storm...

415
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,481
And you stand in front of a tree...

416
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,529
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.

417
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:51,922
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

418
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,404
Three hundred bucks goes
a long way toward retirement.

419
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,260
Go down to Texas, find me
a decent piece of land,

420
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,249
and start   in the wind.

421
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,380
Get me the   out of this
godforsaken place.

422
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,404
Ree done that to you?

423
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,651
I am just asking.

424
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,324
Yeah, they done it.

425
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,491
They took their sweet time with it.

426
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,900
At the start, I did not feel nothing.

427
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,764
I just heard the sound...

428
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,243
of the knife scraping
against my skull and...

429
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,088
them all laughing and whooping
and hollering and whatnot.

430
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,930
Then the blood came.

431
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,980
It was cold. It started
streaming down my face,

432
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,605
in my eyes, and...

433
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,604
breathing it in.

434
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,764
Choking on it.

435
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,922
that is when I felt it.

436
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,602
Yeah, felt all of it.

437
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,760
I got my head turned inside out.

438
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,860
Jesus.

439
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,962
Them Indians down Texas way...

440
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,124
they may rob you, but they
am not going to take your topknot.

441
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,885
When was it?

442
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,580
  it,

443
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,968
will you quit that noise now, will you?

444
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,486
Quit it.

445
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,580
I am falling further back

446
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,251
from Henry and the boys
on account of tending to you.

447
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,321
Got to get up the   mountain,
but winter keeps chasing us down.

448
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,528
If you ready to take the sacrament...

449
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,682
I can do that for you.

450
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,922
What you holding to, Glass?

451
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,681
You know...

452
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,260
it would be better...

453
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,540
if you were to take that
last breath of yours now...

454
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,130
for all of us.

455
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,523
Now you hung tough.

456
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,450
And that is something.

457
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,860
I am begging you.

458
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,140
Them Ree are so close I can smell them.

459
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,540
You can smell them, too.

460
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,020
You got to think of your boy. All right?

461
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,724
because you are going to   him.

462
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,100
you will   us all.

463
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,300
I can muzzle you if you like.

464
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,300
Take away this suffering quick and easy.

465
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,404
No one ever has to know that you give up.

466
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,643
All you have to do is blink
if you want me to do that.

467
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,161
Save your boy and blink.

468
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,241
You just have to blink.

469
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,607
Yeah. There it is.

470
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,602
you would best hope the good Lorthell
get His   here quick, ha?

471
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,820
Maybe he shall forgive your sins, maybe not.

472
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,020
Thus I do commend thee to the Lord.

473
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,969
Through Jesus Christ the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

474
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,700
and the Father
and the Creator, I hold thee...

475
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,020
Get away! Get away!

476
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,647
You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!

477
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,780
Help!

478
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,211
Calm down.

479
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,129
Jim! Help!

480
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,860
do not shout!
you are going to get us all killed!

481
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,340
Keep away!
I will tell the Captain what you did.

482
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,965
they will hang you!

483
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,460
they will hang you! Jim, help!

484
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,642
We have an understanding.

485
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,380
what is   wrong with you people?

486
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,331
 .

487
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,242
I got one  , Hawk.

488
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,730
Breathing changed?

489
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,243
I had not noticed.

490
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,403
 , he is cold as ice.

491
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,060
Here you go, Mr. Glass.

492
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,925
This will help you. Keep you warm.

493
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,251
it is all right.

494
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,605
where is Hawk?

495
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,524
He am not with you?

496
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,820
No.

497
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,251
No?

498
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,340
I understand, Mr. Glass.

499
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,444
it is all right.
I think I will get a fire going.

500
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,286
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

501
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,771
Hawk!

502
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,451
Hawk!

503
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,700
Shh. Ree.

504
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,700
there is about 20 of them
down by the creek.

505
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,646
they are headed this way.
Grab your   and let us go.

506
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,900
 . What do we do?

507
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,729
Run, right now.

508
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,980
What about Hawk?

509
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,980
He am not our problem no more.

510
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,460
We cannot just leave him.

511
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,220
Either he is gutted or scalped.

512
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,740
And if he am not he can find us, cannot he?

513
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,660
What about Glass?

514
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,100
He am not our problem.
Like us, he is on his own.

515
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,780
We made a promise to the Captain.

516
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,500
A proper burial when the time was needed.

517
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,500
He needs that rifle!

518
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,900
He could not do nothing with it
if you tarred it to his hand.

519
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,740
We cannot do this.

520
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,500
We got no   choice.

521
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,523
No, we cannot. Look at him.

522
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,020
All right,  , then, buddy. Get him up.

523
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,420
You want to take him?

524
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,690
Come on now!

525
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,804
Easy. Slowly, Fitz. Easy with him.

526
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,820
Just get your  .

527
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,365
Get your  !

528
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,531
Shut up.

529
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,805
Shut up!

530
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,566
Hold up!

531
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,540
Fitz. What are you doing?

532
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,340
What does it look like?

533
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,700
Proper burial. Like you wanted.

534
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,620
No, not like this.

535
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,881
Why not?

536
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,411
he is alive, Fitz. he is alive.

537
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,891
So shoot him.

538
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,842
I have to go. I have to go.

539
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,241
I am sorry, Mr. Glass. I am sorry.

540
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,924
I am sorry, I am sorry.

541
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,602
Captain! This way!

542
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,126
there is a path down here!

543
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,580
There am not   down there!

544
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,100
We got to climb over!

545
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,620
Glass said to stay east!

546
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,121
Glass can go to  !

547
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,340
what is the map say?

548
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,780
Keep climbing. We climb, Captain.

549
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,530
We keep climbing.

550
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,449
Till we reach Old Gabe.

551
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,971
We climb.

552
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,805
We got to wait for Murph.

553
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,804
Yeah. You wait for him.

554
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,971
Captain?

555
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,220
Sir...

556
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,660
Murphy says there is a way down there.

557
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,220
Who we following?

558
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,780
You follow who you want!

559
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,405
I am going up!

560
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,980
Stubby, keep going up!

561
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,321
Murph! Come here!

562
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,410
I am not leaving you, son.

563
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,966
I am right here.

564
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,445
Fire's done.

565
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,442
I cannot even feel my feet.

566
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,500
did not we put enough distance
between us and them Ree?

567
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,620
A dozen Ree can make
twice as good time as we can.

568
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,484
- Twenty.
- What?

569
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,260
You said you saw twenty Ree.

570
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,601
Yeah? What you talking about?

571
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,370
- You woke me up.
- Mmm-hmm.

572
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,860
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.

573
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,100
Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen...
it do not matter.

574
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,807
I was not going to hang around
counting   feathers.

575
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,211
As a matter of fact...

576
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,725
what was you doing down
by the creek all by yourself?

577
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,767
I would already brought up plenty of water.

578
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,726
Hey!

579
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,246
Answer me, Fitzgerald.
I asked you a question.

580
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,500
do not question me
on account of you feel guilty.

581
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,860
Answer me or I will   your head off.

582
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,122
You got a short-term memory, boy.

583
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,650
Your   would be floating around
the Missouri right now if it was not for me.

584
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,642
You want to ask questions?

585
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,081
What you want to ask?
If you want to know, ask it.

586
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,540
Hmm?

587
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,180
You want to know why you left
Mr. Glass back there for dead, ha?

588
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,540
Or why you left your little boyfriend
running around?

589
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,484
You want to know if he is still alive?

590
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,002
I will tell you why.
it is because you am not a man yet.

591
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,300
it is because you was scared shitless.

592
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,820
you are scared now.

593
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,260
The Ree.

594
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,691
What of them?

595
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,420
Tell me, did you see them?

596
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,682
- Put your rifle down.
- Did you see the Ree?

597
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,120
No.

598
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,203
Not a single one.

599
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,340
You   lied to me? You lied to me!

600
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,726
I had to scare some sense into you, boy.

601
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,202
Glass was dead. Hawk we do not know about.

602
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,211
No point in either of us
dying either, you understand?

603
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,660
The way I see it,
I saved your life twice now.

604
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,888
I ought to be   to you.

605
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,723
And   giveth... and   taketh away.

606
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,525
Lucky  .

607
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,180
Next time you want to shoot somebody...

608
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,770
you might want to use powder,
prime your rifle.

609
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,401
Come on. let us git. Grab your  .

610
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,690
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.

611
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,726
A dead boy.

612
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,449
A Pawnee boy.

613
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,205
let us go.

614
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,460
Who did this?

615
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,562
I do not know.

616
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,803
Could be Captain Leavenworth's boys.

617
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,489
Mmm. Yeah.

618
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,246
Put some eyes on the back of your head.

619
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,642
These Injuns am not never
as dead as you think they are.

620
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,540
Look at them, ha?

621
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,060
they are always stealing our  .

622
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,522
We got horses over here!

623
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,210
Hey, Bridger.

624
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,290
We got horses!

625
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,122
What you want to do about these pigs?

626
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,406
The Lorthes on our side, kid.

627
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,324
You all right there, kid?

628
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,563
Your head in the right place?

629
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,571
I guess.

630
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,331
I cannot help thinking about
whether we did the right...

631
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,900
am not our place to wonder.
The good Lord...

632
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,243
got us on a road
whether we choose it or not.

633
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,740
My pop, he were not
a religious man, you know?

634
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,980
If you could not grow it,
  it, or eat it,

635
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,004
he just plain old did not believe in it.

636
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,208
And this one time he head on
up the old Saba hills.

637
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,845
San Saba hills?

638
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,206
He joined a couple Texas
Ranger buddies of his to hunt.

639
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,683
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.

640
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,740
Should have been a 3-day  ,
but on the second day,

641
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,729
it all went  .

642
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,441
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.

643
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,040
And to top it off, them Comanches
went and took the horses.

644
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,280
So he was starving and delirious...

645
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,201
and he crawls up into this mott, this...

646
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,780
group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere

647
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,486
just sticking up in this ocean of scrub...

648
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,882
and he found religion.

649
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,565
At that moment, he told me...

650
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,723
he found  .

651
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,926
a-ha.

652
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,768
And it turns out that  ...

653
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,490
he is a squirrel.

654
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,245
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.

655
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,446
"I found  ," he used to say.

656
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,500
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory

657
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,523
"and sublimity of mercy..."

658
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,685
"I shot and ate that son of a  ."

659
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,126
Mmm.

660
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,443
Yeah. You might want to
close your eyes, kid.

661
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,163
I am injured.

662
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,889
What happened to you?

663
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,649
A bear.

664
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,489
A bear.

665
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,130
Grizzly.

666
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,845
Grizzly.

667
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,846
My men... left me for dead.

668
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,326
Killed my son.

669
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,366
I lost my family too.

670
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,371
Sioux killed my people.

671
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:04,483
I am going south to find more Pawnee.

672
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,287
My heart bleeds...

673
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,685
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

674
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,204
You will ride with me...

675
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,083
Your body is rotten.

676
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,450
Need to heal.

677
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,485
You could die.

678
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,164
Yeah! There she is.

679
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,011
We did it.

680
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,480
You ought to be proud of yourself, boy.

681
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,420
Yeah.

682
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,740
We followed orders.

683
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,002
We just skipped the funeral part.

684
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,802
do not go down there
and start growing no conscience.

685
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,740
because sure as nightoll come they will
have us swinging from a couple ropes.

686
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,525
We did what we had to do.

687
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,521
We had the extra day
so we managed to dig...

688
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,010
a little deeper, lay rocks on top
so scavengers could not get at him.

689
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,369
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.

690
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,940
Sir, can we...

691
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,220
The truth is that...

692
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,724
when Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about savages.

693
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,209
And I was ready to get, to move on out.

694
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,406
Yeah, but, Bridger here argued to stay.

695
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,340
He argued to stay...

696
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,444
so he could at least
build a cross or something...

697
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,460
to put on top of Glass's grave,

698
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,540
and that is what he did.
that is what we did.

699
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,100
I am glad you pulled
your weight, Mr. Bridger.

700
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,820
He more than pulled his weight, Captain.

701
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,321
This man here, he was my partner.

702
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,340
Am I to assume that the agreed
arrangement did not change?

703
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,330
a, fortunately for me, it did not.

704
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,965
Mmm-hmm.

705
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,770
Thank you...

706
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,125
for your courage, honor, and service.

707
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,121
Deal or no deal, Mr. Bridger,
you deserve something for what you did.

708
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,805
Thank you.

709
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,687
Kithes been beating himself up
awful bad the whole trip.

710
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,180
We all saw the shape Glass was in.

711
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,806
There was no more to be done. Right?

712
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,167
Yeah.

713
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,161
We all saw him.

714
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:22,323
When there is a storm...

715
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,084
And you stand in front of a tree...

716
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:36,566
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.

717
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:51,047
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

718
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,611
There are traces of a camp...

719
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,140
There are traces of a camp...

720
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,208
Where?

721
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,563
Entering the moon forest.

722
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,925
Maybe from two days ago.
They are moving east.

723
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,644
Tell the others.

724
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:34,767
let us move quickly,
Powaqa could be with them!

725
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,762
Bring me the girl...

726
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,881
Those five horses were not for free.

727
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,444
Shh...

728
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,803
do not make a sound.

729
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:44,482
I will get a horse.

730
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,162
I will cut off your  .

731
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:10,530
Where is Toussaint?

732
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,287
Come here...

733
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,443
- May I join you?
- Yes.

734
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,681
Yeah?

735
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,780
Yes.

736
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,700
I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul.

737
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,485
because them pelts we collected

738
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,260
are still out there, you know...

739
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,940
under a couple foot of dirt and snow.

740
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,660
But that am not my fault.

741
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,100
I am waiting for Captain Leavenworth
to arrive with his army.

742
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,460
Then we will have enough men...

743
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,020
to shoot some civilization into those
  Arikara and get back our pelts.

744
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,248
All right. All right.

745
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,247
when is that supposed to happen?

746
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,891
I do not know.

747
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,402
But until then, nobody gets paid.

748
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,722
Listen here, all right?

749
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,721
I was hired to trap them.
I was not hired to guard them.

750
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:56,449
The way I see it, now you, you got a safe.

751
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,380
it is probably full of money.

752
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,260
You signed a contract to protect your boss

753
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,601
and your boss's property.

754
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,540
And that safe is not full anymore.

755
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,927
it is short about $300.

756
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,921
What the   is that supposed to mean?

757
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,163
It means, according to my records...

758
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,169
you purchased more goods on the expedition

759
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,601
than what you are owed by the company.

760
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,602
Now, Happy New Year, Fitzgerald.

761
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,889
Fryman! White man at the gate!

762
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,805
Speak English.

763
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,140
I have no weapon.

764
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,940
Open her up!

765
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,460
Get the Captain!

766
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,607
Where are your men?

767
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,980
All dead.

768
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,366
Who was he?

769
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,460
I do not know. Something to eat, please?

770
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,130
Food comes at a price.

771
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,620
I have no money.

772
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,220
Then you do not eat.

773
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,060
Give back some of them stolen pelts
you buy from the Injuns.

774
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,620
- Not now, Jones.
- Ha?

775
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:13,722
Silver. How is this? Silver.

776
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,251
This all you got?

777
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,322
We was nine.

778
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,160
My friend, he die in the snow.

779
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:27,482
And the other was...

780
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,842
  by wolf. I see it.

781
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,322
By wolf, yeah,  .

782
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,250
where did you get this?

783
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,171
Canteen.

784
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,171
He drop it.
He   Toussaint, he drop it...

785
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,460
Who? Who?

786
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,688
I do not know. I do not see.

787
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,647
It could be Hawk.

788
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,931
Yeah, could be.

789
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,100
That half-breed runt
could not steal no horse.

790
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,900
- Maybe it was Weston.
- Or Beckett.

791
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,340
How far from here?

792
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,771
Thirty mile.

793
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,460
Northwest, near the Yellowstone.

794
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,940
The Yellowstone!

795
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,700
Get the horses saddled.
Torches and supplies.

796
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,500
Ten dollars a man.

797
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,180
Anderson, you stay here.

798
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:09,170
Yes, sir. Feed him and watch him.

799
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,010
I will get you a drink.

800
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:31,448
When we get to the Yellowstone,
we split into two groups!

801
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,211
Hawk!

802
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,442
Hawk, you out there?

803
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,202
Whoa! Whoa!

804
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,124
Keep your guard up!

805
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,405
Eyes in front!

806
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,485
Who are you?

807
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:23,563
Beckett? Is that you?

808
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,526
Glass?

809
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:38,807
Glass!

810
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,100
Jesus Christ!

811
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,089
Jesus Christ, what happened?

812
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,340
Where is he?

813
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,521
Jones, take him. Go.

814
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,844
I am riding ahead. Bill, take Bridger.

815
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:56,365
Take Bridger!

816
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,521
Have you seen Fitzgerald?

817
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,971
No, sir.

818
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,940
Get up. Get up!

819
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,804
- You seen Fitzgerald?
- No, sir.

820
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,041
Fitzgerald?

821
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,690
- Whoa, easy.
- Where did he go?

822
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,406
- Who?
- Fitzgerald. Where did he go?

823
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,700
I have no idea.

824
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,260
Tell me or I will take your head off.

825
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,300
I swear to  ...

826
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,300
Tell me. Tell me!

827
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,700
Texas!

828
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,060
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was going to reenlist.

829
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:54,580
Then he started talking about property.

830
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,580
"A decent piece of land."

831
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,180
he is heading for Texas. that is all I know.

832
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,645
Stay here.

833
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,250
Fitzgerald!

834
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:08,284
Fitzgerald!

835
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,290
  it!

836
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,644
  it!

837
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,180
Jones! Get the Captain!

838
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,460
Fryman!

839
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,700
Open the gate!

840
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,325
Open it up!

841
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,730
Murphy, get the Captain.

842
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,731
Get him to the doctor. Now!

843
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,540
You said he was dead!
You said he was dead!

844
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,721
I thought he was, I swear!

845
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,980
He lied to me!

846
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,460
you are a liar.

847
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:16,131
You left him out there!

848
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,924
Say the Lorthes Prayour.

849
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:21,163
Say the Lorthes Prayour!

850
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:26,980
Our Father, Who art in heaven.
Who art... I cannot!

851
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:28,820
Shut up! Shut up!

852
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,820
From here out, you are a prisoner
charged with treason!

853
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:36,500
Take him to the cage! Take him
to the cage or you will hang alongside him!

854
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:38,762
I thought he was going to die!

855
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:41,929
Fitz lied to me!

856
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,280
I could not help him!

857
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,580
Glass!

858
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,409
Fitz lied to me!

859
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,860
How is he?

860
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,380
he shall be fine, but there is swelling.

861
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,811
He needs to rest.

862
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:28,008
I will be back to check up on him.

863
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,561
He ran off, did not he?

864
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,527
Bridger's telling the truth.

865
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,691
how is that?

866
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:58,001
Fitzgerald lied to him.
He was just following orders.

867
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:02,885
He was not there when Fitzgerald
stabbed my boy to death.

868
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,530
Is that what happened?

869
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,285
He killed Hawk.

870
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,940
I need a horse and gun.

871
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:22,380
No, you need to rest and eat.
I am going after him.

872
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,766
No.

873
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:26,804
you will never find him without me.

874
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:29,780
If we wait till morning he shall get away.

875
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,484
No, he will not.

876
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,483
he is afraid.

877
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:38,484
He knows how far I came for him.

878
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:40,700
Same as that elk.

879
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,247
When they get afraid,
they run deep into the woods.

880
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,691
I got him trapped.
He just does not know it yet.

881
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:50,923
How can you be so sure?

882
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,564
because he has everything to lose.

883
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:59,166
All I had was that boy.

884
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,482
And he took him away from me.

885
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,220
I cannot let you go back out there.

886
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,924
Not again.

887
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:15,845
I am not afraid to die anymore.

888
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:19,449
I done it already.

889
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:27,123
I am going with you.

890
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,328
that is his horse, all right.

891
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:49,700
No way he could have ridden him
through the night.

892
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,529
How far ahead?

893
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,122
Half a day at the most.

894
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,204
Could be Ree.

895
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,607
If they are not his, we lose him.

896
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,966
Unless he reenlisted so he
could justify killing again...

897
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,260
these tracks right here are his.

898
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:18,120
I cannot remember my wife's face.

899
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,486
Last week, she was still with me.

900
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,804
Now she is gone.

901
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,168
I worry I will not recognize her
when I get back home.

902
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,641
Is it true you killed an officer?

903
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,688
I just killed the man
who was trying to   my son.

904
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,771
Smoke.

905
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,451
How close?

906
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:23,361
No more than a mile up that way.

907
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,888
I am going to head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

908
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,601
let us see if we can find some tracks.

909
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,289
And if it is the Ree?

910
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:37,123
If it is the Ree, you turn right
back around and meet me back here.

911
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,804
Now, I would not expect to find
a man of your stature...

912
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:11,380
so far away from his stove
on a morning as cold as this, Captain.

913
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,811
You lost?

914
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,486
I am here to take you back to Fort Kiowa...

915
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,962
where you will be tried for  .

916
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,651
Is that so?

917
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:22,167
I am not crazy about your plan.

918
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:24,642
Besides, I got one of my own.

919
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,845
We had a deal, Glass!

920
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,380
I tried to tell your boy, all right?

921
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,420
I tried to tell him,
but he would not listen

922
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,180
and he kept on screaming.

923
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,806
He was going to get everybody killed.

924
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:13,410
But you and me... we had a deal.

925
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,727
You know what happened out there.

926
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,140
And on my soul, the Lord... He knows...

927
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:23,083
what happened out there.

928
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,564
There was no deal.

929
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,369
You killed my boy.

930
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,089
Well, maybe you should have raised a man,
instead of some girlie little  .

931
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:53,763
  it.

932
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:20,806
You came all this way
just for your revenge, ha?

933
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:25,561
Well, you enjoy it, Glass.

934
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,370
because there am not nothing
going to bring your boy back.

935
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,004
No, it will not.

936
02:21:55,560 --> 02:22:00,566
Revenge is in Gothes hands...

937
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,486
not mine.

937
02:22:04,305 --> 02:22:10,392
