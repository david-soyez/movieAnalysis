00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,776
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

3
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,653
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

4
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,863
Believe me

5
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,989
this is better.

6
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,867
Who are you working for?

7
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,827
Lermentov, yes?

8
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,456
Does he think

9
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
we have to go through him

10
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,335
to move our cargo?

11
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,382
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

12
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,760
Solohob

13
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,012
a bagman, a front.

14
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,644
Your outdated information betrays you.

15
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,814
The famous Black Widow

16
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,820
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

17
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,866
You really think I'm pretty?

18
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,829
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

19
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,708
to move the tanks.

20
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,295
Tell him he is out.

21
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,339
Well...

22
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,396
It's for her.

23
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,192
You listen carefully

24
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,688
Who are you?

25
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,315
Get out!

26
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,984
There is sickness here!

27
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,072
My father's not waking up!

28
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,782
He has a fever and he's moaning

29
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,033
but his eyes won't open.

30
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,118
Slow down.

31
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,662
My father...

32
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,332
Like them?

33
