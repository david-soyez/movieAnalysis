2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,965
Stark!

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,600
He doesn't seem happy.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,045
Hello, Hank.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,370
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,204
I took a detour...

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,408
Through your defense lab.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,481
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,610
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,968
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,565
You were instructed to go to Russia.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,642
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,846
I'm a scientist.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,570
Then act like one.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,240
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,406
Help us put it to good use.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,881
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,883
and now you try to steal my research?

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,284
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,886
Ah...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,968
Easy, Hank.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,971
You mention my wife again

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,088
and I'll show you ferocity.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,764
Don't look at me. You said it.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,161
I formally tender my resignation.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,561
We don't accept it. Formally.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,926
Hank,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,729
we need you.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,121
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,521
Don't let your past determine the future.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,524
As long as I am alive,

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,082
nobody will ever get that formula.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,762
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,047
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,645
Yes.

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,724
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,888
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,130
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,690
He's no security risk.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,604
Unless we make him one.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,606
You like that?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,086
You like that?

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,605
Come get you some now.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,366
You didn't even move.

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Nah.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,241
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,281
You see this right here?

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,610
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,523
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,361
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,408
All right, break it up.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,801
Break it up! Break it up!

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,206
Scotty!

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,009
What's up, man!

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,565
Damn! Hey.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,927
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,085
Hey, what's up with your eye?

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,243
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,209
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,248
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,446
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,682
Well, I definitely didn't.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,765
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,731
Hey, how's your girl, man?

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,961
Oh, she left me.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,891
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,205
And my dad got deported.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,841
But I got the van!

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,445
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,687
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,250
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,765
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,446
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,170
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,561
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

79
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,124
I got a daughter to take care of.

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,407
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,404
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,321
I'm gonna be fine.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,042
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,121
Uh, no, thanks.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,649
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,291
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,284
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,249
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,767
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

91
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,441
Dude.

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,329
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,004
Sure thing, Dale.

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,850
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,809
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,566
Pull up some chair.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,242
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,526
You found out.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,841
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,287
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,006
No one would hire me.

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,526
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,762
Look, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,330
I don't do it anymore. I just...

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,401
Respect.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,681
I couldn't be happier about it.

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,171
- Really?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,203
Thank you. Thank you.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,851
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,446
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,046
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,202
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,647
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,047
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,565
Well, you're fired, of course.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,365
I can't really keep you on.

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,124
Wait, what? Fired?

118
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,281
Yeah.

119
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,362
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

120
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,324
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

121
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,726
I'll tell you what, though.

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,963
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,044
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,451
on your way out the door,

125
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,966
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,851
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,129
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,043
I was. I got fired.

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,849
Damn. They find out who you are?

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,967
Yeah.

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,769
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

132
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,763
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,089
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

134
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,611
Oh. That's Kurt.

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,000
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

136
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,361
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

137
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,287
Who are you?

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,721
Dave.

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,610
Nice work on the Vista job.

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,846
Vista job, yes.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,400
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,848
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,651
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

144
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,165
You mean you're a pussy.

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,321
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,243
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

147
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,765
And it added up to millions.

148
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,729
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

149
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,566
And what does he do?

150
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,563
He hacks into the security system

151
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,325
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,323
Posts all the bank records online.

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,049
What are you doing?

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,167
Hmm?

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,241
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

157
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,606
What do you want?

158
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,681
Okay.

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,161
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,527
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,001
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

162
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
No!

163
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,441
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,568
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

165
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,608
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

166
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,762
I don't care. I'm out.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,851
Dr. Pym?

168
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,321
Yes. I'm still alive.

169
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,447
ID?

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,968
Perhaps that will suffice.

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,202
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

172
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,488
Is that Hank Pym?

173
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,846
Good morning, Hank.

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,121
Hope.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,524
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

177
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,008
More like "thrilled."

178
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,091
What's the occasion?

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,049
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

181
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,244
We're ready for you inside.

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,441
Ouch.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,967
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,724
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

185
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,682
You're in for a treat.

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,125
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

187
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,364
How's your face?

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,169
After you.

189
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,969
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,407
This company's founder and my mentor,

191
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,081
Dr. Hank Pym.

192
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,688
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

193
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,001
I immediately started
researching a particle

194
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,845
that could change
the distance between atoms,

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,764
while increasing density and strength.

196
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,323
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

197
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,689
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

198
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,683
But just imagine,

199
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,004
a soldier the size of an insect.

200
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,010
The ultimate secret weapon.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,002
An Ant-Man.

202
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,328
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,125
Silly, I know.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,690
Propaganda.

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,849
Tales to astonish!

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,288
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

207
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,206
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

208
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,807
every single time I asked you,

209
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

210
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,610
Just a tall tale.

211
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,727
Right.

212
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,883
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

213
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,927
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,844
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

215
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,969
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,444
Could that be done?

217
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,251
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Distinguished guests,

219
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,760
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

220
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,649
The Yellowjacket!

221
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,766
Oh, no.

222
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,162
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

223
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,251
capable of altering the size of the wearer

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,402
for the ultimate combat advantage.

225
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,491
<i>We live in an era</i>

226
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,801
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

227
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,963
<i>are undermined
by constant surveillance.</i>

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,769
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

229
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,688
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

230
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,046
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

231
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,962
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

232
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,407
<i>The Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict</i>

233
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,845
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

234
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,002
<i>completely unseen.</i>

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,005
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

236
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,326
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

237
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,084
<i>industrial sabotage,</i>

238
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,283
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

240
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,401
<i>offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

241
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,011
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

242
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,291
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

243
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,249
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

244
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,690
So, it's a suit?

245
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,849
Don't be crude, Frank.

246
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,049
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

247
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,011
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,970
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,010
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

250
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,691
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,524
I really value your opinion.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,044
Thank you for coming. Hope?

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,491
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

254
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,686
Thank you.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,525
You seem a bit shocked.

256
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,889
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

257
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,962
So you finally admit it!

258
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,247
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

259
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,525
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

260
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,046
Don't do this.

261
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,284
Dr. Cross?

262
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,285
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

263
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,249
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

264
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,526
Deal.

265
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,407
We have to
make our move, Hank.

266
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,527
How close is he?

267
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,285
He still can't shrink a live subject.

268
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,931
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,001
No.

270
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,129
I have Cross' complete trust.

271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,362
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

272
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,002
Well, that's not entirely true.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,843
I think I found a guy.

274
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,685
Who?

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,490
Daddy!

276
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,050
Peanut! Oh!

277
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,322
Happy birthday!

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,401
I'm so sorry I'm late.

279
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,084
I didn't know
what time your party started.

280
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,650
It was on the invitation.

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,484
He didn't get an invitation.

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,085
But he came anyway!

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,130
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,964
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

285
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,041
Oh, you don't...

286
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,121
What are you doing here, Lang?

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,725
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

288
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,484
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

289
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,641
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

290
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,042
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

291
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,291
Hey, look what I have for you.

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,771
Can I open it now?

293
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,569
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

294
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,530
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

295
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,761
What is that thing?

296
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,569
He's so ugly!

297
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,122
I love him!

298
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,725
Can I go show my friends?

299
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,723
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,040
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

301
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,208
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

302
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

304
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,690
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

305
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,360
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

306
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,727
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

307
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,847
It's a birthday party.

308
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,604
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

309
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,681
She's my daughter.

310
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,171
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

311
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,325
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

312
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,363
Your fiancé is an asshat.

313
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,521
He's not an asshat.

314
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,490
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

315
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,925
Stop it.

316
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,248
Really, Maggie? That guy?

317
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,924
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,365
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

319
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,090
At least he's not a crook.

320
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,684
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

321
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,127
I had a job and...

322
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,687
I wanna provide.

323
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,326
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

324
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,401
So much.

325
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,802
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

326
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,881
What do I do?

327
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,966
Get an apartment,

328
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,926
get a job, pay child support.

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,209
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

330
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,728
You're her hero, Scott.

331
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,890
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

332
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

333
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,088
Yeah. Well, uh...

334
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,643
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

335
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,924
It'd be nice though, right?

336
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,407
But there are laws.

337
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,525
What laws? Of man?

338
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,046
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

339
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,282
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

340
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,643
Darren, I don't think you understand...

341
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,641
Hmm.

342
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

343
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,771
Goodbye, Frank.

344
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,924
Thank you.

345
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,805
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

346
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,247
And today,
during my morning meditation,

347
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,244
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

348
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,606
How's that?

349
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,489
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

350
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,487
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

351
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,166
I devoted my genius to him.

352
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,083
I could have worked anywhere.

353
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,410
I chose my mentor poorly.

354
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,049
You didn't even have a choice.

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,047
He never believed in you.

356
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,682
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

357
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,084
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

358
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,730
Because his failures as a mentor,

359
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,928
as a father,

360
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,603
forced us to spread our wings.

361
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,362
You're a success, Darren.

362
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,521
You deserve everything
coming your way.

363
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,721
Ooh.

364
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,490
Stop cheating.

365
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,810
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

366
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,043
Maybe he didn't hear you.

367
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,161
How was the party?

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

369
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,528
I wanna know about that tip.

370
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,251
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

371
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,721
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

372
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,086
It's gotta be airtight.

373
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,961
Okay.

374
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,281
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

375
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,681
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

376
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,080
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

377
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,766
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

378
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,047
<i>It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.</i>

379
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,770
It's the wrong details.

380
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,171
It has nothing to do with the story.

381
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,281
Go.

382
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,761
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a housekeeper now, right?</i>

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,162
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

384
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,323
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

385
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,767
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

386
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,922
<i>That is all retired now, but he's loaded.</i>

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,721
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

388
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,444
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

389
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,967
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

390
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,125
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

391
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

392
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,761
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

393
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,162
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

394
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

395
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,767
<i>"All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

396
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,002
<i>"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."</i>

397
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
What?

398
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Old man have safe.

399
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,762
And he's gone for a week.

400
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,808
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

401
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,006
and he's gone for a week.

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,161
Let's just work with that.

403
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,685
You know what I'm saying?

404
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,690
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

405
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,047
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

406
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,121
Comm check.

407
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,360
- Check.
- Check.

408
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,607
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

409
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
Don't worry.

410
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,207
It's not gonna happen.

411
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,444
I love it when he gets cocky.

412
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,561
Damn!

413
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,361
Alarm is dead.

414
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,527
Nice.

415
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,161
<i>All right,
I'm moving through the house.</i>

416
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,249
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

417
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,926
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,082
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

419
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,083
Not necessarily.

420
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,161
I'm in.

421
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,449
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

422
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,044
Oh, man.

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,491
<i>What is it?</i>

424
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,851
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

425
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,161
<i>How serious
are we talking, Scotty?</i>

426
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,924
It's a Carbondale.

427
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,411
It's from 1910.

428
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,245
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

429
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Wow.

430
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,051
Can you crack it?

431
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,522
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

432
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,926
Remember what that iceberg did?

433
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,729
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

434
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,801
Killed everybody.

435
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,405
Did not kill the Old lady.

436
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,682
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

437
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,450
<i>What are you doing?</i>

438
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,160
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

439
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,041
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

440
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,522
<i>- What are you doing now?</i>
- Waiting.

441
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,121
Waiting.

442
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,361
Nice.

443
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,250
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

444
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,363
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

445
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,889
- It's a suit.
- What?

446
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,409
It's an old motorcycle suit.

447
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,329
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

448
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,845
No.

449
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
It's a bust.

450
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,286
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

451
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,124
I know you needed to score.

452
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,251
I thought we were using mice.

453
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,241
What's the difference?

454
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,481
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

455
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,369
Darren, maybe we should think...

456
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,002
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

458
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,764
Experiment 34-C results,

459
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,887
negative.

460
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,841
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

461
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,650
Why would you lock this up?

462
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,601
This is so weird.

463
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,971
Scotty, what's up, man?

464
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,607
I wonder... What is this?

465
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,521
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

466
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,001
What? Who said that?

467
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,329
Luis, down here!

468
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,761
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

469
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,887
<i>water.</i>

470
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,647
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

471
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,805
Oh, I don't want to see this!

472
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,720
Luis!

473
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,687
Son of a...

474
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,211
What the hell?

475
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,760
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

476
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,968
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

477
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,088
No! No! No, thank you!

478
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,368
Get down on the ground!

479
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,851
You are under arrest!

480
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,685
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

481
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,801
Oh...

482
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,770
Don't move.

483
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,046
<i>You know,
you almost had us convinced</i>

484
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,248
that you were gonna change your ways.

485
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,962
They were really rooting for you.

486
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,602
It's gonna break their hearts.

487
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,761
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

488
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,201
Your lawyer.

489
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,331
My lawyer?

490
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,886
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

491
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,366
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

492
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,201
Oh, man.

493
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,886
Sit down.

494
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,564
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

495
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,529
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

496
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,568
Maggie was right about you.

497
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,161
How do you know about...

498
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,280
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

499
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,249
The moment things get hard,

500
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,765
you turn right back to crime.

501
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,442
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

502
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,171
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

503
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,843
or go back to your cell

504
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
and await further instructions.

505
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,411
I don't understand.

506
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,642
No, I don't expect you to.

507
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,769
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

508
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,171
neither do I.

509
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,926
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

510
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,161
What?

511
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,643
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

512
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,769
So, next time you think
you might see one,

513
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,323
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

514
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,567
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

515
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,680
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

516
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,643
No, I love this one.

517
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,971
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

518
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,011
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

519
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,401
Is Daddy a bad man?

520
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,844
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

521
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,926
No.

522
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,849
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

523
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,284
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

524
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,321
<i>Under the door.</i>

525
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
Okay, where to now?

526
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,122
<i>- Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

527
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,961
What, what?

528
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,041
Where the hell did he go?

529
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,406
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

530
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,448
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

531
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,726
Get back! Get back!

532
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,406
<i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

533
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,330
Is that a camera on an ant?

534
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,289
Yeah, sure. Why not?

535
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,361
Where's the car?

536
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,090
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

537
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,446
<i>Incoming!</i>

538
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,409
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

539
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
- How safe is...
<i>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

540
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,087
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

541
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,601
<i>So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

542
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,330
All right.

543
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,368
- Now, what's the next move?
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

544
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,204
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

545
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,930
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

546
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,048
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

547
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,531
Wait, his name is 247?

548
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,364
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

549
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,966
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

550
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,809
Whoa!

551
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,723
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

552
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,285
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

553
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,362
<i>- No, I think it's 247.</i>
- Wait.

554
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,290
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

555
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,328
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

556
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,284
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

557
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
What?

558
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,329
- Can I make one little request?
<i>- No.</i>

559
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,723
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

560
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,681
Time out.

561
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,841
All right, hold on.

562
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,809
Just wait! Whoa!

563
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,050
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

564
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,488
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

565
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,164
Let's set her down, all right?

566
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,241
I'm getting light-headed.

567
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,401
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

568
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,048
I'm getting a little light...

569
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,043
I need a snooze button.

570
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,927
Hit me in 5 minutes.

571
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,760
Hello.

572
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,361
Who are you?

573
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,205
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

574
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,361
Yes.

575
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,601
Why?

576
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,600
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

577
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,603
Oh. Oh.

578
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,441
Hey, look...

579
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,361
Whoa!

580
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,729
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

581
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,290
Giant tropical bullet ants,

582
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,960
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

583
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

584
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,765
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

585
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,361
Who?

586
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,721
Hey!

587
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,485
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

588
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,803
How am I supposed to do this?

589
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,123
All right, just one step at a time.

590
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,241
Ugh!

591
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,403
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

592
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,521
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

593
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,806
We don't need this guy.

594
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,360
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

595
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,011
I did. She's great.

596
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,321
She doesn't think that we need you.

597
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

598
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,083
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

599
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,731
and then Hope has you arrested.

600
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,804
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

601
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,524
She's a little bit anxious.

602
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,525
It has to do with this job,

603
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,126
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

604
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,441
I take it that you're interested in.

605
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,646
What job?

606
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,881
Would you like some tea?

607
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,129
Uh... Sure.

608
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,804
I was very impressed with

609
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,690
how you managed to get
past my security system.

610
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,924
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

611
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,445
Were you watching me?

612
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,729
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

613
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,201
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

614
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,444
Oh! Excuse me.

615
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,488
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

616
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,091
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

617
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,889
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

618
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,883
But you beat it.

619
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,291
Would you like some sugar?

620
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,930
Yeah, thanks.

621
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,080
You know what?
I'm okay.

622
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,202
How do you make them do that?

623
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,931
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

624
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,641
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

625
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,882
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

626
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,449
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

627
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,529
I speak to them.

628
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,001
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

629
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,491
and see everything.

630
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,449
And still know absolutely nothing.

631
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,087
I'm late to meet Cross.

632
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,684
Uh... Dr. Pym?

633
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,081
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

634
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,291
Sorry, I just have one question.

635
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,488
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

636
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,210
and can I go back to jail now?

637
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,691
Come with me.

638
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,450
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

639
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,726
Huh?

640
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,041
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

641
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,849
That's what powers the suit.

642
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,604
That's why it works.

643
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,801
Wow.

644
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,804
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

645
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,562
It was too dangerous.

646
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,768
So I hid it from the world.
