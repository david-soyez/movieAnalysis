2
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:35,166
Start simple.
Start with what you know is true.

3
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:39,956
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

4
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:43,348
I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped.

5
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,961
Peeto... Peeto was left behind.

6
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,433
Miss Everdeen?

7
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:55,007
You cannot be in here.

8
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:58,772
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

9
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:03,280
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

10
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,395
Just five more minutes.

11
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,837
No.

12
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:12,371
No, please, do not.
it is just five more...

13
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:16,593
do not touch me! do not!
No! No! Get off of me!

14
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,689
Finnick.

15
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:20,208
I wanted to go back
for Peeto and Johanna,

16
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,611
but I...

17
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,784
I could not move.

18
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,017
They have Annie, too. They took her.

19
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,026
She is...

20
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:39,313
She is in the Capitol.

21
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,233
I wish she was dead.

22
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:50,352
I wish they were all dead
and we were, too.

23
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,115
Miss Everdeen.

24
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:23,475
Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

25
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:27,187
I know you have been discharged, but Presidid not
Coings requested to meet with you first.

26
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,266
Is there any news?

27
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,513
I am just here to escort you.

28
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:04,883
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

29
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,507
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.

30
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,665
But we are military,
so we learned to survive down here.

31
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,358
Preparing, training.

32
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,746
The war never stopped for us.

33
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:51,123
There she is. Our Girl on Fire.

34
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:54,835
Madam Presidid not,
may I present you with The Mockingjay.

35
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:57,683
What an honor it is to meet you.

36
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,131
you are a courageous young woman.
I know how disorienting this must be.

37
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:05,587
And I cannot imagine what it is like to live
through the atrocities of those Games.

38
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:09,171
Katniss, Presidid not Almom Coin.

39
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,498
Please know how welcome you are.

40
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:17,305
I hope you will find some comfort with us.
we have known loss in 13, too.

41
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:22,067
This is history.
Right here at this table.

42
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:25,207
I apologize. I wish you had
more time to recover, but unfortunately,

43
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:28,240
we do not have that luxury.
Please, have a seat.

44
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,041
Are you aware of what is happened?

45
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:36,848
When you fired your arrow
at the force field

46
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:39,347
you electrified the nation.

47
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:44,268
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

48
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,643
We believe that if we
keep this energy going

49
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,427
we can unify the districts
against the Capitol.

50
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,243
But if we do not, if we let it dissipate,

51
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,219
we could be waiting another
75 years for this opportunity.

52
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:59,027
- Everyone in 13 is ready for this.
- What about Peeto? Is he alive?

53
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:02,611
I do not know. And I wish that I did.

54
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:05,715
But there is no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

55
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,427
The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

56
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:12,819
But I know their system very well.

57
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,595
I managed to break through.
All we need now is the perfect message.

58
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,803
Katniss, here is what we need to do.

59
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,363
We need to show them that
The Mockingjay's alive and well

60
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,243
and willing to stand up
and join this fight.

61
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,139
because we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

62
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,055
The way you did.

63
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:36,339
So we are going to shoot
a series of propaganthe clips,

64
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,507
propos, I like to call them,
on The Mockingjay.

65
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:41,427
Spreads the word

66
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,083
that we are going to stoke
the fire of this rebellion.

67
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:46,771
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

68
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:49,203
You left him there.

69
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:52,979
- You left Peeto in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

70
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,802
Peeto was the one
who was supposed to live.

71
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,484
Miss Everdeen.

72
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,435
This revolution is about everyone.

73
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:04,177
it is about all of us.
And we need a voice.

74
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,728
Then you should have saved Peeto.

75
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,553
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

76
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,497
Oh, no.

77
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:24,787
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

78
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:26,959
This is not the girl you described.

79
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:32,435
Obviously, we need to make it personal.
Remind her who the real enemy is.

80
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,163
She knows who the enemy is.
that is not the issue.

81
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,176
Unless she is forgotten.

82
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,504
there is explaining and there is showing.

83
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:42,994
Let her see what the Capitol did to 12.

84
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:46,993
She cannot handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

85
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,736
This is the only choice you have.

86
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:54,130
People do not always show up the way
you want them to, Madam Presidid not.

87
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:57,786
But that anger, that anger-driven defiance,
that is what we want.

88
00:07:57,882 --> 00:08:01,011
And we can redirect it.
We need to unite these people out there

89
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:04,467
that have been doing nothing but killing
each other in an arena for years.

90
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,314
We have to have a lightning rod.

91
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:11,027
they will follow her.
She is the face of the revolution.

92
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,913
Let her see it. Let her go home.

93
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,264
Send her.

94
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,560
I cannot believe
you are going through with this.

95
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,283
You can say "no."

96
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:49,586
I need to see it for myself.

97
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,176
This way.

98
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:50,288
13 swept everything, top to bottom
so you would be safe.

99
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,450
You sure you do not
want me to go with you?

100
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:57,168
Yeah. I am sure.

101
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,576
we will have our eyes on you from above.

102
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,444
Figures.

103
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,610
Hey!

104
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,464
Come on.

105
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,632
do not you want to see Prim?

106
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,951
There you go. you are breakin' my heart.

107
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,272
Egeria!

108
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,392
We need to fix these lines.

109
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,754
I will not say "rebels."

110
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:00,041
These are senseless acts of defiance.

111
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:01,840
And I will not legitimize them.

112
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,968
we will call them "criminals."

113
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,386
"Radicals."

114
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:16,400
Otherwise we are breaking my oldest rule.

115
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,176
Never let them see you bleed.

116
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,507
Citizens,

117
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:30,127
tonight I address all of Panem as one.

118
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,171
Since the Dark Days,

119
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,203
Panem has had an
unprecedented era of peace.

120
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,562
It is a peace built upon cooperation.

121
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:43,499
And a respect for law and order.

122
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:47,122
In the past weeks,
you have heard of sporadic violence

123
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:52,114
following the actions of a few
radicals in the Quarter Quell.

124
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,891
Those who choose this destructive path,

125
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,290
your actions are based
on a misunderstanding

126
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:02,355
of how we have survived. Together.

127
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,465
It is a contract.

128
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:10,386
Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.

129
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:15,634
In return, the Capitol provides
order and security.

130
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:18,354
To refuse work

131
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:22,221
is to put the entire system in danger.

132
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:25,778
The Capitol is the beating
heart of Panem.

133
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:28,436
Nothing can survive without a heart.

134
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,399
The criminals that kneel before you

135
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,242
use symbols for the purpose of sedition.

136
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:39,634
Which is why all images
of The Mockingjay

137
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,008
are now forbidden.

138
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:45,330
Possessing them will be
considered treason.

139
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,407
Punishable by death.

140
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:51,056
Justice shall be served swiftly.

141
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,387
Order shall be restored.

142
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:58,268
To those who ignore
the warnings of history,

143
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,018
prepare to pay the ultimate price.

144
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,786
it is okay.

145
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,322
we are okay.

146
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,593
we are all here now.

147
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,127
Buttercup!

148
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,470
I smuggled him in.

149
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,864
I got Dad.

150
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,304
And I got some of your herbs
from the kitchen.

151
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:16,114
They have strict rules.

152
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,502
I do not know what they will do
if they find him here.

153
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:34,965
You should try to eat something.

154
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,649
Hello. Good evening.

155
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,818
And a big welcome to all in Panem.

156
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:56,883
I am Caesar Flickerman. And whoever
you are, whatever it is you are doing,

157
00:18:56,978 --> 00:19:00,466
if you are working, put down your work.
If you are having dinner, stop having dinner.

158
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:04,594
Because you are going to want
to witness this tonight.

159
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:09,939
There has been rampant speculation about
what really happened in the Quarter Quell.

160
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:14,546
And here to shed a little light on the
subject for us is a very special guest.

161
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:18,639
Please welcome Mr. Peeto Mellark.

162
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:21,042
Peeto, a lot of people

163
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,178
feel as though they are in the dark.

164
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:26,706
Yeah, I know how they feel.

165
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,498
Now, so set the stage for us.

166
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:31,474
Talk us through what really happened

167
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,034
on that final and controversial night.

168
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,123
Well, first off, you have to understand
that when you are in the Games

169
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:42,962
- you only get one wish. it is very costly.
- you are alive.

170
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,266
- It costs your life.
- I think it costs more than your life.

171
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,738
How do you mean?
what is more than your life?

172
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,994
I mean to   innocent people,
that costs everything that you are.

173
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,274
Yes.

174
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,730
So you hold on to that one wish.

175
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,482
And that night my wish
was to save Katniss.

176
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,890
Yes.

177
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,706
I should have just run off with her
earlier in the day like she had wanted.

178
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:07,826
But you did not. Why?
Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?

179
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,863
No, I was caught up
trying to play allies.

180
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,592
And then they separated us and...

181
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,399
that is when I lost her.

182
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,145
And then the lightning hit...

183
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:23,858
and the whole force field
around the arena just blew out.

184
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:28,838
Yes, but, Peeto,
Katniss is the one who blew it out.

185
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,226
- No.
- You saw the footage.

186
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:32,786
No, she did not know what she was doing.

187
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:36,274
Neither of us knew there was a
bigger plan going on. We had no idea.

188
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,486
- You had no idea?
- No.

189
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:42,226
All right. Well, Peeto, there are many
who find this suspicious to say the least.

190
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:46,418
It seems as though
she was part of a rebel plan.

191
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:50,067
Do you think it was part of her plan
to be almost killed by Johanna?

192
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:52,722
Or part of the plan to be
paralyzed by lightning?

193
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,787
No, we were not part of any rebel plan.
We had no idea what was going on.

194
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,786
All right. I believe you,
Peeto Mellark. Thank you.

195
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:01,674
Yeah.

196
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,986
And I was going to ask you
to speak about the unrest

197
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:07,826
- but I think you might be too upset.
- No, I can.

198
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,458
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

199
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,244
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

200
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,706
I want everyone who is watching to stop

201
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,970
and to think about
what a civil war could mean.

202
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:26,568
We almost went extinct once before.
And now our numbers are even fewer.

203
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,242
- he is one of them.
- Is this really what we want to do?

204
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,929
- he is a traitor.
-   ourselves off?

205
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:34,483
- Killing is not the answer.
- I cannot believe he is doing this.

206
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,786
Everyone needs to lay down
their weapons immediately.

207
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:39,634
- Traitor!
- he is not one of us!

208
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,330
This is treason!

209
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,463
Are you calling for a ceasefire?

210
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,545
Yeah. I am.

211
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,498
- you are a puppet!
- Hang him!

212
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:52,242
I want everyone to stop
the senseless violence.

213
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,378
- This is not the path to change.
- Traitor!

214
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:58,168
it is not the path to justice.

215
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,511
There cannot be a ceasefire.

216
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,064
Not after everything Snow's done.

217
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,361
He could have done
a lot of damage tonight.

218
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,042
Most districts, people are still too afraid
to join. They need the courage.

219
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,563
Why do you think he said that?

220
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:38,862
I do not know. Maybe he was forced.

221
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:45,647
He did not look that bad.

222
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,190
Maybe he made some kind
of deal to protect you.

223
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,197
he is still playing the game.

224
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,679
No! No! No!

225
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,970
I am sorry. it is just a nightmare.

226
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,144
that is okay. I get them, too.

227
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:21,231
Peeto,

228
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,768
will you stay with me?

229
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:26,863
Yeah.

230
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,329
Always.

231
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,047
Hey.

232
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,862
cannot sleep?

233
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,574
Tell me what is happening.

234
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,452
I am good at keeping secrets.

235
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:15,192
Even from Mom.

236
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:23,567
No one hates the Capitol more than me.

237
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:29,006
And I want to help.
But I just keep thinking,

238
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:33,321
even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeto?

239
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:37,810
I know he is not safe there,
but he is definitely not safe here.

240
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:41,777
I do not think you know
how important you are to them.

241
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:45,359
If you want something,
you just have to ask.

242
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,073
You could demand almost anything.

243
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,826
they would have to agree to it.

244
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,480
I should wake you up
more often, Little Duck.

245
00:24:56,624 --> 00:24:58,351
Get some sleep now.

246
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,137
You, too.

247
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,490
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

248
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,722
I have decided I will be your Mockingjay.

249
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:16,111
But I have some conditions.

250
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:25,714
Peeto and the other Tributes,
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresto,

251
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,209
will be rescued
at the earliest opportunity.

252
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:32,913
If and when Peeto is liberated, he will
receive a full and unconditional pardon.

253
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:37,709
No punishment will be inflicted.
And the same goes for the other Tributes.

254
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,343
No.

255
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,874
it is not their fault
you abandoned them in the arena.

256
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,176
they are doing and saying
whatever they can to survive.

257
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:50,642
Individuals do not make demands in 13.

258
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:54,415
There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.

259
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:55,920
Thank you.

260
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:58,993
The Victors will be granted immunity.

261
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:02,418
And you will announce that
in front of the entire population of 13.

262
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:05,074
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

263
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,442
or you will find another Mockingjay.

264
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:10,738
that is it. that is her. Right there.

265
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,450
is not that who I promised you?
She wears the costume.

266
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:17,010
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

267
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,671
Our Mockingjay.

268
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:23,410
Madam Presidid not, we are losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

269
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,321
This is worth the risk.
She is worth the risk.

270
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,786
Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people.

271
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:32,114
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

272
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,847
in wartime I think even the noblest of
causes can be bent a little bit. Right?

273
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,983
Do you have any other conditions?

274
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,736
My sister gets to keep her cat.

275
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,883
Go away.

276
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,327
Is it visiting hours again?

277
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:16,111
Miss Trinket,

278
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:19,473
you see this door.

279
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:22,066
It opens. From the inside.

280
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:25,746
I have told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

281
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:29,424
you are not a prisoner.
you are free to join the rest of 13.

282
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:33,842
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

283
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,817
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

284
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:38,514
Katniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay.

285
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:42,642
- That poor thing.
- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.

286
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:45,007
I need you to join this team now.

287
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:48,689
- I need someone she trusts.
- What about Haymitch?

288
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:51,538
he is drying out in some
facility a mile down.

289
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:54,961
Aiding rebels is not really my forte.

290
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:59,570
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

291
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,748
no matter what happens here.

292
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:05,170
If you want to play
a prisoner of war, fine.

293
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:09,168
Stay here and rot. I will find someone
else to be The Mockingjay's escort.

294
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,280
Who?

295
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:18,063
Anyone can be replaced.

296
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,751
Not your Mockingjay.

297
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,511
There is not a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

298
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:33,647
You honestly believe one of these cave
dwellers is going to take my place?

299
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,535
No.

300
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,177
Good afternoon.

301
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,282
Thank you for interrupting
your schedules.

302
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:58,546
They have already been
adjusted to compensate...

303
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:00,562
I hardly ever see children around here.

304
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,289
Please, check in with your unit...

305
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:05,393
A lot of them were lost in
an epidemic a few years ago.

306
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:08,529
- I have an announcement for the citizens of 13.
- Coin lost her family, too.

307
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,129
Daughter and a husband.

308
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,753
And our welcome guests from 12.

309
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:17,074
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

310
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,009
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

311
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:26,481
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

312
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,506
First, we will assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

313
00:29:31,794 --> 00:29:34,241
held hostage in the Capitol.

314
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:36,272
Peeto Mellark,

315
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:41,201
Johanna Mason...

316
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:44,911
- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.
- ...and Annie Cresto.

317
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:49,874
Once freed, they will be granted
full pardon for any and all crimes

318
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,481
committed against the rebel cause.

319
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,026
Good.

320
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,582
that is good, Katniss.

321
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,866
If Katniss Everdeen
fails to fulfill her duties

322
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:04,945
the deal will be off.

323
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,806
Thank you for your attention.
Please, resume your daily schedules.

324
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,505
- Madam Presidid not.
- Effie Trinket.

325
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,073
Welcome to 13.

326
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:20,080
Madam Presidid not,
may I say you are so very...

327
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:22,455
concise.

328
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:24,625
You believe that
there is more to be said?

329
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:28,401
- May I speak freely?
- You do not appear to do anything else.

330
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:31,953
I am only talking about salesmanship.

331
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:34,994
The thing with revolutions,
they are a tender flame.

332
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,698
They need to be nurtured with
a little kindling and warmth.

333
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:42,710
- Bit of oxygen.
- Oxygen.

334
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,202
One sure way to put it out
is to smother it.

335
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,090
Or to use up all the air in the room.

336
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:49,614
Excuse me.

337
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:55,503
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

338
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:57,711
Effie?

339
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,354
- What are you doing here?
- I am a political refugee.

340
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:11,026
- Plutarch rescued you?
- Rescued, yes, that is what he calls it.

341
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,746
You and I were both in the dark.

342
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:17,105
Now I am condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

343
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,602
It is wonderful to see you again.

344
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:24,281
Can you believe this place?

345
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,050
I miss coffee.

346
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:32,005
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict. I mean,

347
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,638
I thought at least
in the higher ranks there would be some...

348
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,377
side action. I miss my wigs.

349
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:42,993
Luckily, I remembered that this was
all the rage when I was coming up.

350
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:46,382
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

351
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,840
Like democracy.

352
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,623
Which brings me to this.

353
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,286
Cin a.

354
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,318
he is dead, is not he?

355
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,895
Yes, dear.

356
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,233
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

357
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,143
until you would decided to be
The Mockingjay on your own.

358
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:24,942
He knew the risks. As we all do.

359
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:29,583
He believed in this revolution.

360
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,721
He believed in you.

361
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,703
they are beautiful.

362
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:41,166
They have it.
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

363
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,630
there is not much of a prep team
here in 13 but we will make you

364
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,639
the best-dressed rebel in history.

365
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:55,948
Okay.

366
00:32:57,073 --> 00:32:58,288
Bring up the lights.

367
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,295
Cin a's final touch.

368
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:26,737
Everyone's either going to want to
kiss you,   you, or be you.

369
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:28,366
Perfect.

370
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,545
Absolutely perfect.

371
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,944
Okay. let us bring up the setting.

372
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,698
Little wind.

373
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:45,234
Okay, Katniss, we are going to
start you down on one knee.

374
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:50,482
And as you rise up, you are going to hold
your flag in the air and deliver your line.

375
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:54,226
And remember you have just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol

376
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:56,273
arm-in-arm with your
brothers and sisters.

377
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,422
Okay.

378
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,245
Whenever you are ready.

379
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:07,374
People of Panem,
we fight, we dare, we...

380
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:10,609
Does she know the line?

381
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:12,145
- I know it. I got it. I am sorry.
- Okay, All right.

382
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,034
- let us do it again.
- She is warming up.

383
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,722
All right. With energy. Go.

384
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:22,994
People of Panem, we fight!
We dare to end this hunger for justice!

385
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:25,554
you have just been in battle!

386
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,799
I am sorry. Excuse my outburst.
you have just been in battle.

387
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:34,383
let us try it again.
Whenever you are ready.

388
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,297
People of Panem, we fight!

389
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:42,447
We dare to end this hunger for justice.

390
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:56,429
And that, my friends,
is how a revolution dies.

391
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:01,614
Hello, Katniss.

392
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,606
This how you greet an old friend?

393
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,807
Maybe I do not recognize you sober.

394
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:14,318
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.

395
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:18,354
People of Panem, we fight!

396
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,734
We dare! We end this hunger for justice!

397
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:34,353
Madam Presidid not,

398
00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:37,010
indulge me for a moment, if you would.

399
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:42,577
let us everybody think of one incidid not where
Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.

400
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:47,666
Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle
or her dress went up in flames

401
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,577
or she made a halfway
decent shot with an arrow.

402
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:54,129
And not where Peeto made you like her.

403
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:59,535
No, I would like you all to think of one moment
where she made you feel something real.

404
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:04,433
When she volunteered
for her sister at the Reaping.

405
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:07,246
Excellent example.

406
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,854
Okay.

407
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:11,850
I hope that was not important.

408
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:15,953
Okay. "Volunteer for sister."

409
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,017
Good. What else?

410
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:21,104
When she sang that song for little Rue.

411
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,242
Oh, yeah.
Who did not get choked up at that?

412
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,960
You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.

413
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:29,198
Well, I like you better sober.

414
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,560
When she chose Rue as an ally, as well.

415
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,369
- Yes.
- Now, what do all these have in common?

416
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,672
No one told her what to do.

417
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:42,289
Unscripted, yes. So maybe we
should just leave her alone.

418
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:44,433
And wash her face.

419
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,673
She is still a girl.
You made her look 35.

420
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:51,697
The opportunities for spontaneity
are obviously lacking below ground.

421
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,826
So what you are suggesting
is we toss her into combat?

422
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:58,192
I cannot sanction putting
an untrained civilian

423
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:01,873
in battle just for effect.
This is not the Capitol.

424
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,689
That is exactly what I am suggesting.
Put her in the field.

425
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:07,505
- No, we cannot protect her.
- It has to come from her.

426
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:12,081
that is what people respond to.
You want a symbol for the revolution?

427
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:14,577
She can not be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

428
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:16,657
Maybe there is someplace
that is less dangerous.

429
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:20,529
District 8. They reported heavy bombing
last week. There are no military targets left.

430
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:24,448
- We cannot guarantee her safety.
- you will never be able to guarantee my safety.

431
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,919
- I want to go.
- And if you are killed?

432
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:31,055
Make sure you get it on camera.

433
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:37,166
I have made you some surprises.

434
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,686
Maybe you want to try one out.

435
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:49,422
If you are going to be a part of Katniss'
propo team, you may as well look the part.

436
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:06,574
And this one is for you.

437
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:12,544
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon
for the sake of the propos but...

438
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,447
I could not just make you
a fashion accessory.

439
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,311
it is beautiful.

440
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:23,630
And look here.

441
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,009
Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows.
All color-coded.

442
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,913
And tell Finnick

443
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,463
I have got a tridid not for him
when he is ready.

444
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:43,630
Might just cheer him... Cheer him up.

445
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:49,518
let us not fire the red ones in here.

446
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:10,510
You had all of this and you just left
the districts to fend for themselves?

447
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:14,641
it is not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

448
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:17,489
We were not in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.

449
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:19,921
Yeah, we could have bombed the Capitol
but they would have retaliated

450
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:22,677
with at least twice the firepower.
Then what?

451
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:26,865
There would have been nobody
left to claim victory.

452
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:30,478
Sounds like exactly what Peeto said
and then you all called him a traitor.

453
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:34,926
This way, soldier.

454
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,606
You are camera-ready.

455
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:43,021
does not your comrade look handsome?

456
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:46,879
let us go.

457
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:50,698
Come back safe.

458
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:54,448
Quick introductions, Katniss.

459
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:57,841
These people have come a long way to
support the cause. This is Cressithe.

460
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,009
In my opinion one of the best
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol.

461
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:04,657
- Until I up and left. Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:07,733
let us see what you can do. Be careful.

463
00:40:08,464 --> 00:40:11,825
- This is my assistant, Messalla.
- it is an honor to meet you.

464
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,897
- And your cameramen over there, Castor.
- Hello.

465
00:40:14,993 --> 00:40:16,527
And Pollux.

466
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:20,621
let us get locked in.

467
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:29,456
you are all from the Capitol?
Plutarch got you out?

468
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,633
do not expect much chitchat from him.

469
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:35,281
he is an Avox.
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago.

470
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:40,204
And, no, it was not any sort of rescue,
if that is what you mean.

471
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,817
We all fled on our own. For this.

472
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:45,839
For you.

473
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,780
This has have got to be fast. In and out.

474
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:37,451
Move out.

475
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,449
you are alive then. We were not sure.

476
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,689
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.

477
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,512
Katniss has been recovering,
but she insisted on coming out

478
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,975
- and seein' some of your wounded.
- Well, we have got plenty of those.

479
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:09,295
We have a mass grave
a few blocks west, but,

480
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:12,175
I cannot spare the manpower
to move them yet.

481
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:14,225
Hospital's past that curtain.

482
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,528
Any hope you can give them,
it is worth it.

483
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:19,345
The Capitol's done everything
they can to break us.

484
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:22,001
are not you worried about having
all your wounded in one place?

485
00:42:22,097 --> 00:42:24,590
I think it is better
than leaving them to die.

486
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:27,921
- that is not what I meant.
- Well, that is my only other option.

487
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,926
If you can come up with another,
I am all ears.

488
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:33,101
it is right through here.

489
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:48,270
do not film me in there.
I cannot help them.

490
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,406
Just let them see your face.

491
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,302
Excuse me.

492
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,695
- Yeah.
- You all right?

493
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:18,416
it is okay. Here, it is okay.

494
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,693
I have got you. I have got you.
it is all right.

495
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:51,790
Katniss Everdeen?

496
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:57,229
What are you doing here?

497
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:00,769
I came to see you.

498
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,790
What about the baby?

499
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:12,093
- I lost it.
- Are you fighting, Katniss?

500
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,222
You here to fight with us?

501
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:18,894
I am.

502
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:21,902
I will.

503
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,175
Tighter.

504
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,366
Tighter, tighter.

505
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:55,857
Sir, some cameras
were damaged in the bombings,

506
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:59,502
but we confirmed it is her.

507
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:04,077
Zoom in.

508
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:14,702
She was visiting a makeshift hospital.
we are not sure if she is still there.

509
00:45:18,223 --> 00:45:20,657
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

510
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:23,127
We may be able to target her.

511
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:26,234
  the wounded.

512
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:27,993
Sir...

513
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,853
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.

514
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,696
Any association with
the Mockingjay symbol

515
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:37,769
is forbidden.

516
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:42,062
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

517
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:48,337
Show them what it costs
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.

518
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:51,377
Your momys going to be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

519
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:55,601
- Will this play in the districts?
- it will be tattooed on their eyes.

520
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:58,897
- there is a problem.
- What kind of problem?

521
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:01,265
Incoming bombers from the north.

522
00:46:01,745 --> 00:46:04,653
- We need to find cover now.
- there is a bunker in there.

523
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,405
Straight ahead and down the stairs.

524
00:46:20,752 --> 00:46:22,365
Katniss!

525
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:23,822
Katniss!

526
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,509
Everdeen!

527
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,331
Everdeen!

528
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:30,287
Gale, back away from the wall!

529
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:47,193
You okay?

530
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:54,519
Move!

531
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:04,335
- they are going after something to the south.
- that is towards the hospital.

532
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:11,726
they are circling back around. Come on!

533
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:51,916
that is the hospital.
they are targeting the hospital.

534
00:48:43,759 --> 00:48:45,424
Help them!

535
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,310
Help them! Get them out!

536
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:51,633
Katniss?

537
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:54,669
Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you are seeing right now?

538
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:00,014
Katniss, what do you want to say?

539
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:12,460
I want the rebels
to know that I am alive.

540
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:15,121
That I am in District 8

541
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:18,161
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital

542
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:22,385
filled with unarmed men,
women and children.

543
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:24,654
And there will be no survivors.

544
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:31,727
If you think for one second that
the Capitol will ever treat us fairly

545
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:33,744
you are lying to yourselves.

546
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,148
Because we know who they are
and what they do.

547
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:41,710
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

548
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,200
I have a message for Presidid not Snow.

549
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:54,158
You can torture us and bomb us
and burn our districts to the ground.

550
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:57,485
But do you see that?

551
00:49:58,255 --> 00:50:00,120
Fire is catching.

552
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:05,134
And if we burn, you burn with us!

553
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,569
We know who they are and what they do.

554
00:50:27,664 --> 00:50:30,353
This is what they do!

555
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:32,533
And we must fight back.

556
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:36,752
You can torture us and bomb us

557
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,345
and burn our districts to the ground.

558
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,136
Plutarch's faith in you
was not misplaced.

559
00:50:41,232 --> 00:50:43,760
- But do you see that?
- Thank you.

560
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:46,577
- Fire is catching.
- Come up with me for the beginning.

561
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:50,211
And if we burn, you burn with us!

562
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,813
There is no progress without compromise.

563
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,109
No victory without sacrifice.

564
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,888
But I stand here with The Mockingjay

565
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,822
to announce that our moment has arrived.

566
00:51:56,271 --> 00:52:00,858
Beetee has increased
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

567
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:05,072
We will broadcast this message
to all the districts tonight.

568
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:10,820
The Mockingjay's words inspiring
everyone to join the rebellion.

569
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:14,416
Together, we will become

570
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:16,494
an alliance to be reckoned with.

571
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:21,168
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

572
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,886
You do not like hearing
a fight song at a funeral?

573
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,390
The more people on our side,
the closer we are to Peeto and Annie.

574
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:37,709
Yeah.

575
00:52:56,687 --> 00:53:02,064
By order of Presidid not Snow daily production
quotas have been increased.

576
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,096
All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.

577
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:09,518
Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.

578
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:15,214
By order of Presidid not Snow daily
production quotas have been increased.

579
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:02,221
If we burn, you burn with us!

580
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:06,357
Yeah!

581
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,869
Yeah!

582
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:31,568
- I got good news.
- What?

583
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:33,262
Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground.

584
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:25,653
he is not even afraid of us.

585
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:29,581
it is because they have
never been hunted before.

586
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:33,518
it is almost not fair.

587
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,453
They want us back.

588
00:56:58,575 --> 00:57:02,285
- They asked us to head for Command.
- All right. I have got to drop these off.

589
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:09,552
She was arguably

590
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:11,984
our favorite Tribute.

591
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,048
And I think that is what
we all find most astonishing,

592
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:20,942
is that this girl was
adored in the Capitol.

593
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:26,274
And I think for you, Peeto,
it must be particularly painful.

594
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,784
I wish I could give
this rose to you, Katniss.

595
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,992
he is changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?

596
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:35,716
A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired such violence.

597
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:37,744
You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.

598
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,728
- he is shaking.
- I do not think that I could.

599
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:43,408
Unless, of course, Peeto,
you think that perhaps she is being

600
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:48,461
forced into saying things that
she does not even understand.

601
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:52,624
Yeah. Yeah, that is exactly what I think.

602
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,656
- Even his voice is different.
- I think they are using her to whip up the rebels.

603
00:57:56,752 --> 00:58:00,432
I doubt she even knows what is happening.
And what is really at stake.

604
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:03,317
Now, Peeto, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this.

605
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,672
But if they do,
what would you say to her?

606
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:10,765
To Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet
Katniss Everdeen. What would you say to her?

607
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,456
I would... I would tell her
to think for herself.

608
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:15,226
Yes.

609
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:23,120
do not be a fool, Katniss.
I know you never wanted the rebellion.

610
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:29,000
The things that you did in the Games
were never intended to start all of this.

611
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:31,856
The rebels have made you
into something that you are not.

612
00:58:31,952 --> 00:58:34,000
Something that could destroy all of us.

613
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:37,872
So if you have any power or any say

614
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:40,685
in what they do or how they use you,

615
00:58:41,903 --> 00:58:47,182
please, please, urge them to stop
this war before it is too late.

616
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:51,661
And ask yourself, can you trust
the people you are working with?

617
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:57,136
- Do you know what they really want?
- We need to respond.

618
00:58:57,232 --> 00:59:02,448
Thank you, Peeto Mellark, for these
revelations about the real Mockingjay.

619
00:59:02,544 --> 00:59:05,360
- Did you see what he looks like?
- I saw a coward.

620
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:07,879
- You do not have any idea what he is going through.
- I do not care.

621
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:10,671
I would never say what he just said.

622
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,006
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

623
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:15,951
That is the same Peeto that
defended you at the whipping post.

624
00:59:16,047 --> 00:59:19,117
No, it is not.
Now he is only defending himself.

625
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:22,661
Coings called a meeting.
We need to respond.

626
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:25,230
When did "we" become you and Coin?

627
00:59:25,326 --> 00:59:26,992
Everyone has a choice.

628
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:29,957
How can he sit there in the Capitol and
defend the people who destroyed his home

629
00:59:30,053 --> 00:59:32,300
and murdered his family?

630
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:33,708
He does not know.

631
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:38,969
How could he? Nobody's seen
what the Capitol did to 12.

632
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,101
I have to show them.

633
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:59,053
So I want to start with you
in front of the Justice Building, okay?

634
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,750
 . First shot.

635
01:00:16,622 --> 01:00:19,075
Katniss, tell us what happened here.

636
01:00:21,999 --> 01:00:24,336
We were all standin' right here

637
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,573
watchin' the Games
when you fired that arrow.

638
01:00:32,015 --> 01:00:35,743
The screens just went dark.
Nobody had any idea what happened.

639
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,729
Peacekeepers forced us
back into our homes.

640
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:43,341
For maybe an hour,
the town was just dead quiet.

641
01:00:46,286 --> 01:00:49,070
Little past 9:00,
we heard their trucks pullin' out.

642
01:00:51,437 --> 01:00:54,125
All of them. Every single Peacekeeper.

643
01:00:56,303 --> 01:00:58,220
And I knew what that meant.

644
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:05,008
Me and a couple of guys from the mines,
we started pulling people from their houses

645
01:01:05,104 --> 01:01:09,549
and tried to get them to the fence line but
a lot of people were scared of the forest.

646
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:14,349
So they headed up onto the road.
Make a break for it that way.

647
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:24,553
Stay with Gale.

648
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:31,754
915 of us made it to the fence.

649
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,004
Then we watched as...

650
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:38,283
bombers circled back towards the road.

651
01:01:42,669 --> 01:01:45,325
They firebombed them as they ran away.

652
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:03,709
915 out of 10,000.

653
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,165
I should have grabbed people.
I should have dragged them with me.

654
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:19,564
- Some of the kids I could have carried.
- You saved so many people, Gale.

655
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:23,918
Without you, there would be no District 12.
Not even the memory of it.

656
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,421
This is where you kissed me.

657
01:02:58,158 --> 01:03:00,142
I did not think you remembered that.

658
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:12,045
I would have to be dead to forget that.

659
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:15,441
Maybe not even then.

660
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:31,277
I knew you would do that.

661
01:03:32,302 --> 01:03:34,189
How? I did not.

662
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:37,036
because I am in pain.

663
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,701
that is the only way
that I can get your attention.

664
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:50,036
do not worry, Katniss. it will pass.

665
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:11,434
Hey.

666
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:22,828
Yeah, that is a mockingjay.

667
01:04:37,454 --> 01:04:39,633
Well, now they will never shut up.

668
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:46,093
You want me to sing?

669
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,785
<i>Are you, are you</i>

670
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:01,768
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

671
01:05:02,248 --> 01:05:04,622
<i>They strung up a man</i>

672
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,428
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

673
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:12,256
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

674
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:15,343
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

675
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:17,172
<i>In the hanging tree</i>

676
01:05:17,939 --> 01:05:20,651
<i>Are you, are you</i>

677
01:05:20,746 --> 01:05:23,095
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

678
01:05:23,191 --> 01:05:28,492
<i>Where the dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

679
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:33,411
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

680
01:05:33,506 --> 01:05:36,582
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

681
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:38,826
<i>In the hanging tree</i>

682
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,746
<i>Are you, are you</i>

683
01:05:41,842 --> 01:05:44,085
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

684
01:05:44,181 --> 01:05:46,253
<i>Where I told you to run</i>

685
01:05:46,635 --> 01:05:49,491
<i>So we would both be free</i>

686
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:54,399
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

687
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:57,479
<i>If we met at midnight</i>

688
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:59,707
<i>In the hanging tree.</i>

689
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:09,711
That line was originally
"necklace of rope."

690
01:06:09,807 --> 01:06:12,079
I had it changed to "necklace of hope."

691
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:14,959
Wow. You are a true wordsmith.

692
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,423
Little on the nose, but,
of course, so is war.

693
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,165
- Every districtos seeing this?
- Yes. But not the Capitol.

694
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,039
I designed this signal
defense system for them.

695
01:06:25,134 --> 01:06:26,831
But I cannot find my way through it.

696
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:29,264
Guess I did my job too well.

697
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,748
At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.

698
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:36,066
we will get through it.

699
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:05,261
Moves and countermoves.

700
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,156
Katniss, you are wanted in Command.

701
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:40,847
Tonight, we have received reports

702
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,927
of derailed trains,

703
01:09:43,023 --> 01:09:44,848
of granaries on fire,

704
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:49,775
and of a savage attack on the
hydroelectric dam in District 5.

705
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:51,759
What have they done to you?

706
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:56,591
I am begging for restraint and decency.

707
01:09:56,687 --> 01:09:59,407
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled horse manure

708
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:01,516
to bring you...

709
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:08,525
- that is it. that is our footage.
- Beetee's in.

710
01:10:10,575 --> 01:10:13,261
- Katniss?
- He sees it. He sees our propo.

711
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:18,675
- Katniss, are you there?
- Peeto.

712
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:21,388
Katniss?

713
01:10:23,662 --> 01:10:26,272
Peeto, please continue.

714
01:10:27,374 --> 01:10:30,700
You were telling us about
these savage attacks.

715
01:10:31,182 --> 01:10:32,477
Yeah.

716
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:39,368
The attack on the dam

717
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:40,824
was a callous

718
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:45,325
and inhuman act of destruction...

719
01:10:52,142 --> 01:10:53,711
Think about it.

720
01:10:54,223 --> 01:10:58,479
How will this end? What will be left?

721
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,429
No one can survive this.

722
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:05,452
No one is safe now.
Not here in the Capitol.

723
01:11:06,446 --> 01:11:07,870
Not in any of the districts.

724
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,639
they are coming, Katniss.
they are going to   everyone.

725
01:11:14,735 --> 01:11:16,840
And in District 13
you will be dead by morning.

726
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:21,167
- he is warning us. That was a warning.
- Yes, it was.

727
01:11:21,263 --> 01:11:22,659
We have to get him out
before they   him.

728
01:11:22,755 --> 01:11:25,199
- Is there anything in the air?
- Nothing on Doppler, madam.

729
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:26,863
He was in the mansion.
He could have overheard something.

730
01:11:27,055 --> 01:11:28,205
Possibly.

731
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,317
it is time for an air raid drill.

732
01:11:42,286 --> 01:11:48,108
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

733
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:53,166
- Prim! Prim!
- Proceed to your nearest stairwell

734
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,503
and descend to level 40.

735
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:58,700
Blast doors will be
sealed in six minutes.

736
01:12:00,174 --> 01:12:06,031
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

737
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:10,799
Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.

738
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:16,111
Madam Presidid not, three Capitol
squadrons just entered our airspace.

739
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:19,660
- How much time do we have?
- they are a few seconds from range.

740
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,671
- Prepare to scramble the fleet.
- Copy that.

741
01:12:26,766 --> 01:12:29,324
Open up short-range air defense.

742
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:36,750
Arm long-range missiles
for counterattack.

743
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:51,663
This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.

744
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:56,175
Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.

745
01:12:56,751 --> 01:12:58,354
Blast doors...

746
01:13:02,766 --> 01:13:06,351
This is a code red alert.
Please, remain calm...

747
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:25,455
This is a code red alert.
Proceed in an orderly fashion...

748
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:28,652
Come on. Come on, hon.

749
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,175
Continue to the Supply Station
and claim one pack

750
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:42,447
for each member of your compartment.

751
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:46,799
Please keep all personal items
within your assigned area.

752
01:13:46,895 --> 01:13:49,837
Be courteous to your fellow citizens.

753
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,519
This is a code red alert.

754
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:56,815
All citizens should be
inside the bunker.

755
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,915
- Blast doors will close in two minutes.
- Mom!

756
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:05,391
- where is Prim?
- I thought she went to find you.

757
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,333
- She must still be on the stairs.
- there is no one on the stairs.

758
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:13,103
She went back for the cat.

759
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,863
This is a code red alert.

760
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:17,391
All citizens should be
inside the bunker.

761
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:18,579
Hey, stop! Stop!

762
01:14:18,675 --> 01:14:22,092
Blast doors will close in one minute.

763
01:14:27,855 --> 01:14:30,671
They hit the far edge of the
northwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet.

764
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:34,190
Missed the living quarters.
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3.

765
01:14:34,286 --> 01:14:35,879
- Is there any radiation?
- None detected.

766
01:14:35,975 --> 01:14:38,128
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.

767
01:14:38,991 --> 01:14:42,988
- Blast doors will close in 30 seconds.
- Prim!

768
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,915
- Prim!
- Katniss!

769
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,775
- This is a code red alert.
- Katniss!

770
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,383
- Blast doors will close in 15 seconds.
- Keep moving, keep moving!

771
01:14:58,479 --> 01:14:59,629
Get down here!

772
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,053
- Hurry!
- This is a code red alert.

773
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:06,828
- Come on!
- Blast doors will close in 10 seconds.

774
01:15:07,214 --> 01:15:08,427
Nine...

775
01:15:09,197 --> 01:15:10,700
- Eight...
- Come on!

776
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,856
Seven...

777
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,148
Six...

778
01:15:16,302 --> 01:15:18,447
- Five...
- Hold the doors!

779
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:19,791
Four...

780
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,570
Three...

781
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:25,804
- Two...
- Wait! Hold the doors!

782
01:15:25,998 --> 01:15:26,907
One.

783
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,927
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

784
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:33,962
I was not going to leave him behind.
I could not live with myself.

785
01:15:34,895 --> 01:15:36,815
Blast doors are now sealed.

786
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,660
I know, Prim.

787
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,811
let us go.

788
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:51,053
Damage to the aquifer in the northwest
quadrant. We lost a transport corridor.

789
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:52,718
there is nothing else in the northwest.

790
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,887
Our surface-to-air launchers
just took a direct hit in sector 3.

791
01:15:55,983 --> 01:15:59,645
Because we revealed ourselves.
They saw us firing there.

792
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:04,719
Stand down. do not launch the fleet.

793
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:09,326
Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching
sector 3 in attack formation.

794
01:16:09,422 --> 01:16:11,660
Hold fire on their approach.

795
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,263
what did they hit?

796
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,703
Bedrock. But there is debris
in the ventilation shaft.

797
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:21,327
- they are not targeting our fleet.
- Or our Special Weaponry.

798
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:23,439
They do not know what we have
or where we have it.

799
01:16:23,823 --> 01:16:25,710
Can you confirm that everyone's
safely in the bunker?

800
01:16:25,806 --> 01:16:27,019
Already done.

801
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,222
Conceal all remaining
anti-aircraft guns.

802
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:33,007
Seal launching pads
and ventilation corridors.

803
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:36,366
We are going to wait this out.
This is what we are built for.

804
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,511
they will seal us in here like a tomb.

805
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:40,526
The Capitol's working off
some outdated information.

806
01:16:40,622 --> 01:16:44,205
- I would rather not update it for them.
- Madam Presidid not, I know it is not my place...

807
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:47,567
it is not. you are a welcome guest,
but you are out of your depth down here.

808
01:16:47,663 --> 01:16:51,742
- Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it.
- Copy that.

809
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,659
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.
it is going to be a long night.

810
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:35,755
Prim, talk about something. Anything.

811
01:17:38,828 --> 01:17:41,067
They promoted me at the hospital.

812
01:17:41,582 --> 01:17:45,208
I forgot to tell you.
they are training me to be a doctor.

813
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:48,780
they would be   not to.

814
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:01,591
Hey.

815
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:04,652
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

816
01:19:08,782 --> 01:19:11,501
Snow's using Annie to punish you.

817
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:13,836
he is taunting us with them.

818
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,180
I did not understand until just now
watching that   cat.

819
01:19:27,182 --> 01:19:29,742
After your first Games,

820
01:19:29,838 --> 01:19:33,484
I thought the whole romance was an act.

821
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:38,029
We all expected you
to continue that strategy.

822
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:41,262
But it was not until
Peeto's heart stopped

823
01:19:41,358 --> 01:19:43,879
and he nearly died that...

824
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:47,626
I knew I would misjudged you.

825
01:19:48,494 --> 01:19:49,894
You love him.

826
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:54,702
I am not saying in what way.
Maybe you do not even know yourself.

827
01:19:54,894 --> 01:19:57,804
But anyone paying attention can see it.

828
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,637
How do you live with it?

829
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:06,830
I drag myself out of nightmares
and there is no relief in waking up.

830
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:10,348
But... it is better not to give in to it.

831
01:20:12,718 --> 01:20:17,292
Takes 10 times longer to put yourself
back together than it does to fall apart.

832
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,640
Katniss? Katniss?

833
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,108
Come with me.

834
01:20:37,196 --> 01:20:39,724
We took their best shot. did not we?

835
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,350
Yeah.

836
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,646
- Your mother and sister okay?
- Yeah, they are fine.

837
01:20:45,742 --> 01:20:47,886
I need you to do something for us.

838
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:52,110
I need you to tell Panem that we
survived an attack by the Capitol

839
01:20:52,205 --> 01:20:56,747
with no casualties.
And we remain fully operational.

840
01:20:57,421 --> 01:20:58,827
Okay.

841
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:01,038
You should know something.

842
01:21:01,518 --> 01:21:06,092
We had eight extra minutes of civilian
evacuation because of Peeto's warning.

843
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,268
I will not forget that.

844
01:21:09,484 --> 01:21:11,052
Thank you.

845
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:30,412
So Katniss, it is "13 is alive
and well and so am I."

846
01:21:31,693 --> 01:21:33,132
Katniss?

847
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:36,427
Katniss.

848
01:21:37,165 --> 01:21:39,980
Never one to waste it
in rehearsal, I know.

849
01:22:42,413 --> 01:22:44,581
Why would they drop these?

850
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,910
For me.

851
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,013
Ready to go, Katniss?

852
01:22:52,045 --> 01:22:54,123
we are going to do this,
just like District 8.

853
01:22:57,165 --> 01:22:59,243
Tell me about the roses.

854
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:08,715
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

855
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:13,806
he is going to   Peeto.

856
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,462
let us try again. Can you speak up?
We do not have a mic on you.

857
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:20,396
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

858
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:25,707
he is going to   Peeto.

859
01:23:28,172 --> 01:23:30,636
- I cannot.
- Katniss?

860
01:23:31,982 --> 01:23:34,350
- You can do it, Katniss.
- I cannot do this.

861
01:23:34,446 --> 01:23:37,518
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

862
01:23:37,614 --> 01:23:40,494
he is just going to keep...
he is never going to stop.

863
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,182
- Cressithe, we should cut the cameras.
- it is okay, Katniss.

864
01:23:43,278 --> 01:23:46,732
No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

865
01:23:47,693 --> 01:23:50,414
he is doing this because
I am The Mockingjay.

866
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:52,875
he is punishing Peeto to punish me.

867
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:54,502
No.

868
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,838
- No, I cannot do this.
- Katniss.

869
01:23:57,934 --> 01:24:01,358
- do not make me do this!
- Let her go.

870
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:04,843
I got... I have got to get out of here.

871
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:25,774
So this is the end?

872
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:28,556
I s'pose you are just going to
hide down here forever?

873
01:24:29,549 --> 01:24:31,442
I cannot be The Mockingjay.

874
01:24:32,015 --> 01:24:35,020
Not The Mockingjay. Just Katniss.

875
01:24:37,453 --> 01:24:42,124
You know, you are the only
real friend I have down here.

876
01:24:46,189 --> 01:24:50,510
I do not suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

877
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:54,477
- you are unbelievable.
- Okay, but I meant what I said.

878
01:24:54,863 --> 01:24:58,425
Look, the reason I am here
is to let you know

879
01:24:58,732 --> 01:25:00,108
they are rescuing Peeto.

880
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:04,366
- What?
- The dam went down in District 5,

881
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:08,366
took out most of the power to the Capitol.
Knocked out their signal defense.

882
01:25:08,462 --> 01:25:12,651
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

883
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:15,246
A window is open to us.
How much longer? I do not know.

884
01:25:15,342 --> 01:25:17,966
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

885
01:25:18,062 --> 01:25:19,214
And Presidid not Coin?

886
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:24,065
You know, I can never fully support
that woman in light of the...

887
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,400
prohibition they have
going on around this place, but...

888
01:25:28,496 --> 01:25:32,430
Plutarch got word that Peeto and
the others are in the Tribute Center.

889
01:25:32,526 --> 01:25:35,725
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

890
01:25:35,821 --> 01:25:39,726
She knows that Peeto is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you are ours.

891
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:43,438
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

892
01:25:43,534 --> 01:25:45,552
she is going to get him.

893
01:25:45,869 --> 01:25:49,165
- I have to go help.
- Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait.

894
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:52,366
Come on. What, are you just going to jump
out of the vent and go storm the Capitol?

895
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:54,607
Besides, it is already underway.

896
01:25:55,278 --> 01:25:58,382
Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only.

897
01:25:58,478 --> 01:26:01,804
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

898
01:26:02,669 --> 01:26:04,253
Gale.

899
01:26:13,005 --> 01:26:15,022
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

900
01:26:15,118 --> 01:26:17,172
Go in the center there.

901
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:19,533
Those rocks.

902
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:23,824
Castor, to the left.

903
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,713
Pollux, you are with me.
So we will go straight to camera.

904
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,830
Okay? Finnick?

905
01:26:30,926 --> 01:26:32,046
Yeah.

906
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:35,470
Okay. Take your time.

907
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:38,636
Just remember to keep talking
and do not stop.

908
01:26:41,775 --> 01:26:43,797
This is Finnick Odair.

909
01:26:44,749 --> 01:26:47,566
Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.

910
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:51,118
And I am coming to you
from District 13, alive and well.

911
01:26:51,213 --> 01:26:54,222
we have survived an assault
from the Capitol.

912
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:56,942
But I am not here
to give you recent news.

913
01:26:57,038 --> 01:27:00,750
- Why is Finnick doing a propo?
- it is a lot more than that.

914
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:04,366
- Beetee's commandeered the system.
- Now that they are down to generator power

915
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:06,542
there is a more limited range of
frequencies available to them.

916
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,398
And I am filling them
all up with Finnick.

917
01:27:08,493 --> 01:27:11,247
Not many will see it, but whoever does
will think it is another propo.

918
01:27:11,343 --> 01:27:14,686
What they do not know is this broadcast
is jamming their entire system with noise.

919
01:27:14,782 --> 01:27:17,741
Early defense warning,
internal communications, everything.

920
01:27:17,837 --> 01:27:19,150
As long as the broadcast goes through,

921
01:27:19,246 --> 01:27:21,806
our team should be able
to get in and out undetected.

922
01:27:21,902 --> 01:27:24,654
The truth.
Not the myths about a life of luxury.

923
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,886
Not the lie about glory
for your homeland.

924
01:27:27,982 --> 01:27:30,222
You can survive the arena.

925
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:33,131
The moment you leave, you are a  .

926
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:49,390
Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are
one minute out from perimeter defense.

927
01:27:49,814 --> 01:27:53,262
- Going dark.
- Stay low in case they are online.

928
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,430
Presidid not Snow used to sell me.

929
01:27:56,526 --> 01:27:59,662
Or my body, at least.
I was not the only one.

930
01:27:59,758 --> 01:28:03,455
If a Victor is considered desirable,
the Presidid not gives them as a reward

931
01:28:03,551 --> 01:28:08,142
or allows people to buy them.
If you refuse, he kills someone you love.

932
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:11,787
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.

933
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:18,187
Ten seconds.

934
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:20,014
Nine... Eight...

935
01:28:20,302 --> 01:28:22,957
Seven... Six... Five...

936
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:26,443
Four... Three... Two...

937
01:28:27,212 --> 01:28:28,086
One.

938
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,437
No response from perimeter defense.
we are inside Capitol airspace.

939
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:43,298
To make themselves feel better, my patrons
would make presents of money or jewelry.

940
01:28:43,854 --> 01:28:48,430
But I found a much more
valuable form of payment.

941
01:28:48,526 --> 01:28:49,582
Secrets.

942
01:28:49,678 --> 01:28:51,138
Gear up.

943
01:29:10,765 --> 01:29:12,363
Switching to Night View.

944
01:29:20,205 --> 01:29:21,686
There.

945
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:26,926
Command, we have visual
on the Tribute Center.

946
01:29:27,118 --> 01:29:29,259
Initiating final approach.

947
01:29:33,356 --> 01:29:34,636
Masks on.

948
01:29:39,597 --> 01:29:42,958
See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty

949
01:29:43,054 --> 01:29:45,711
of the Capitol's pampered elite.

950
01:29:46,286 --> 01:29:50,412
But the biggest secrets are about
our good Presidid not, Coriolanus Snow.

951
01:29:57,933 --> 01:29:59,038
Open the door.

952
01:30:08,428 --> 01:30:09,517
Command, this is Team Leader.

953
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:13,195
Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.

954
01:30:16,461 --> 01:30:19,854
Such a young man when he rose to power.
Such a clever one to keep it.

955
01:30:19,949 --> 01:30:23,211
How, you may ask, did he do it?

956
01:30:24,748 --> 01:30:26,251
One word.

957
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:28,299
Poison.

958
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:35,993
Get ready to drop.

959
01:31:02,061 --> 01:31:05,863
He stopped every mutiny
before it even started.

960
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,663
Clear.

961
01:31:19,885 --> 01:31:24,046
Clear. Command, we are inside.
Heading toward target number one.

962
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:26,987
Cell P45 lower level 2C.

963
01:31:27,756 --> 01:31:28,785
Gas.

964
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:33,067
There are so many mysterious deaths
to adversaries.

965
01:31:33,933 --> 01:31:35,883
Even to allies who were threats.

966
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:49,614
Snow would drink from the same cup,
to deflect suspicion.

967
01:31:49,806 --> 01:31:52,782
But antidotes do not always work,

968
01:31:52,878 --> 01:31:55,662
which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.

969
01:31:55,853 --> 01:32:00,331
Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.

970
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:25,451
Gale.

971
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:33,486
But he cannot hide the scent of who
he really is. He kills without mercy.

972
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:36,202
He rules with deception and fear.

973
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:04,045
His weapon of choice
is the only thing suited to such a man.

974
01:33:04,141 --> 01:33:08,107
Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.

975
01:33:09,677 --> 01:33:11,065
What is this place?

976
01:33:21,518 --> 01:33:22,957
- Beetee?
- I am losing them.

977
01:33:23,053 --> 01:33:24,427
Powering back up.

978
01:33:26,382 --> 01:33:29,933
madam, the Capitol air defense system
is rebooting. it is coming back online.

979
01:33:30,029 --> 01:33:31,724
Must be diverting power
from another source.

980
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,318
And filtering transmissions.
Another 60 seconds and we will be cut off.

981
01:33:34,414 --> 01:33:36,490
Madam Presidid not, should we
call back the hovercraft?

982
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:39,758
Broadcast me.

983
01:33:40,045 --> 01:33:43,502
If Snow's watching this, maybe he shall
let the signal in, if he sees me.

984
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:45,710
Put me on the air so he can see me.

985
01:33:45,901 --> 01:33:48,302
- Yes. Yes.
- Put her on.

986
01:33:48,398 --> 01:33:50,638
Can we do this? Can we still get in?

987
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,102
Yes. For the moment. The line's open.
He will only see you.

988
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,053
Okay, Katniss, go.

989
01:33:55,149 --> 01:33:57,902
Presidid not Snow?
Presidid not Snow. it is Katniss.

990
01:33:57,998 --> 01:34:00,845
- there is no guarantee he is even watching.
- Presidid not Snow?

991
01:34:00,941 --> 01:34:04,301
- I know, but he might be.
- Presidid not Snow, I need to speak with you.

992
01:34:04,492 --> 01:34:06,092
Are you there?

993
01:34:06,765 --> 01:34:10,346
Presidid not Snow, it is Katniss.
Can you hear me?

994
01:34:11,659 --> 01:34:13,355
I need to speak with you.

995
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:19,747
Presidid not Snow, it is Katniss.
Presidid not Snow, are you there?

996
01:34:23,275 --> 01:34:24,907
Can you hear me?

997
01:34:30,268 --> 01:34:34,346
- Presidid not Snow...
- Miss Everdeen. What an honor.

998
01:34:35,404 --> 01:34:40,043
I do not imagine you are calling
to thank me for the roses.

999
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:43,306
I never asked for this.

1000
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:45,932
I never asked to be in the Games.

1001
01:34:46,316 --> 01:34:49,578
- Boggs? Come in. Boggs?
- I never asked to be The Mockingjay.

1002
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:54,158
Just wanted to save my sister.
And keep Peeto alive.

1003
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:56,903
Come in. Boggs?

1004
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:01,102
Please, just let him go.
And I will stop being The Mockingjay.

1005
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:03,405
I will disappear. You will never
have to see me ever again.

1006
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,516
Miss Everdeen.

1007
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:08,475
- Boggs, come in.
- You could not run from this...

1008
01:35:08,571 --> 01:35:11,918
any more than you could have
run from the Games.

1009
01:35:12,014 --> 01:35:16,524
- Command, I need a situation report.
- Boggs, we are running out of time. Hurry.

1010
01:35:18,285 --> 01:35:19,276
let us move.

1011
01:35:19,372 --> 01:35:20,429
Please.

1012
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:22,738
you have won.

1013
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,385
you have already beaten me.

1014
01:35:30,061 --> 01:35:32,843
Release Peeto. And take me instead.

1015
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:37,709
we are long past the opportunity

1016
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:39,789
for noble sacrifice.

1017
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:43,694
Then tell me what to do.
I have always kept my promises, have not I?

1018
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:49,163
You said you did not want a war.
And that is just what is happened.

1019
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:52,942
I told you what a fragile
thing peace was.

1020
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,766
And still, like a child,

1021
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:58,025
you took pleasure in breaking it.

1022
01:35:58,957 --> 01:36:00,525
I know what you are.

1023
01:36:00,908 --> 01:36:04,237
I know you cannot see
past your narrowest concerns.

1024
01:36:04,429 --> 01:36:07,147
But please, Miss Everdeen.

1025
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:09,934
I doubt you know
what honesty is anymore.

1026
01:36:10,126 --> 01:36:13,037
Command, we are at the first target.
Preparing to extract Peeto.

1027
01:36:13,133 --> 01:36:14,571
Will confirm when he is in hand.

1028
01:36:17,422 --> 01:36:19,438
Mockingjay One,
prepare hovercraft for evac.

1029
01:36:19,726 --> 01:36:22,669
You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeto.

1030
01:36:22,765 --> 01:36:25,098
have not I at least done that?

1031
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:27,179
Miss Everdeen,

1032
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:32,138
it is the things we love most

1033
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:34,379
that destroy us.

1034
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,603
I want you to remember

1035
01:36:38,871 --> 01:36:40,943
that I said that.

1036
01:36:45,259 --> 01:36:49,220
do not you think I know your friends
are in the Tribute Center?

1037
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:51,819
Cut them off.

1038
01:36:53,944 --> 01:36:55,750
- Boggs, come in.
- What happened?

1039
01:36:56,014 --> 01:36:58,253
Boggs, come in. Do you read me?

1040
01:36:58,349 --> 01:37:01,101
- He knows that they are in there. it is a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.

1041
01:37:01,197 --> 01:37:03,758
We have to get a hold of them.
We have to tell them to get out. He knows.

1042
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:05,933
there is no signal.
We cannot contact them.

1043
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:09,677
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

1044
01:37:09,773 --> 01:37:12,365
- No, Haymitch. they are in there.
- No, we do not know that.

1045
01:37:12,461 --> 01:37:15,693
Did I lose them both tonight?
Did I lose them both tonight?

1046
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:17,965
Did I lose them both tonight?

1047
01:37:18,061 --> 01:37:21,293
Did I lose them? I lost them both.

1048
01:37:21,389 --> 01:37:23,306
No! No!

1049
01:37:31,692 --> 01:37:33,067
there is no news.

1050
01:37:35,148 --> 01:37:36,682
I am sorry.

1051
01:37:39,213 --> 01:37:41,899
it is the worst torture in the world.

1052
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:46,827
Waiting, when you know
there is nothing you can do.

1053
01:37:51,757 --> 01:37:54,187
Especially for people like us.

1054
01:37:55,021 --> 01:37:56,995
But whatever

1055
01:37:57,361 --> 01:37:59,738
strength, courage,

1056
01:38:00,012 --> 01:38:01,867
madness,

1057
01:38:02,412 --> 01:38:06,218
keeps us going, you find it,
at times like these.

1058
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,766
You have it, soldier.

1059
01:38:11,054 --> 01:38:14,059
it is what is kept you
alive all this time.

1060
01:38:14,988 --> 01:38:17,131
And it will not fail you now.

1061
01:38:38,156 --> 01:38:39,432
they are back.

1062
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,229
I do not want that.

1063
01:38:53,644 --> 01:38:54,701
Johanna.

1064
01:38:55,084 --> 01:38:56,330
Finnick!

1065
01:38:57,548 --> 01:38:58,734
Finnick!

1066
01:38:59,117 --> 01:39:02,218
Annie? Annie! Annie!

1067
01:39:05,548 --> 01:39:07,882
you are safe. you are safe.

1068
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:15,947
Gale!

1069
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,298
Are you okay?

1070
01:39:21,484 --> 01:39:22,798
What? What is it?

1071
01:39:22,894 --> 01:39:28,363
I do not get it. Every gun was back online
and on us and we flew right past them.

1072
01:39:28,557 --> 01:39:30,442
They let us go.

1073
01:39:35,147 --> 01:39:36,331
he is in there.

1074
01:39:38,476 --> 01:39:42,347
The gas we used on the guards knocked
him out, too, but it is wearing off now.

1075
01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:45,931
You should be there when he wakes up.

1076
01:39:50,763 --> 01:39:52,458
Thank you.

1077
01:39:55,052 --> 01:39:56,618
Thank you.

1078
01:40:15,724 --> 01:40:17,212
Peeto.

1079
01:40:49,675 --> 01:40:50,893
Peeto!

1080
01:40:51,373 --> 01:40:54,861
Peeto! Get off! Get off of her!

1081
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:56,425
Let go!

1082
01:41:29,677 --> 01:41:31,853
No, Katniss.
No, you are swollen. do not touch.

1083
01:41:31,949 --> 01:41:35,179
No, no, no. Calm down.
Calm down. you are okay.

1084
01:41:37,996 --> 01:41:39,594
Tell her she is awake.

1085
01:41:41,516 --> 01:41:43,181
-  ...
- do not try to talk.

1086
01:41:43,277 --> 01:41:45,341
Peeto's okay. I promise.

1087
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,001
I just had to get him off you.

1088
01:41:54,092 --> 01:41:56,512
it is called hijacking.

1089
01:41:57,389 --> 01:42:00,197
We do not know how long the Capitol's
been doing this to Peeto.

1090
01:42:01,131 --> 01:42:04,717
it is fear conditioning.
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

1091
01:42:05,197 --> 01:42:07,726
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1092
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,248
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1093
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:14,038
And they torture him.

1094
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:18,765
With shocks and beatings,
and   down his identity.

1095
01:42:18,861 --> 01:42:21,677
And then all of that suffering
and fear is redirected.

1096
01:42:21,773 --> 01:42:25,564
Associated with other memories
or a person.

1097
01:42:26,509 --> 01:42:28,589
They can change his memories of Katniss?

1098
01:42:28,685 --> 01:42:30,846
To make her seem life-threatening.

1099
01:42:31,532 --> 01:42:35,915
They turned him into a weapon, Katniss.
To   you.

1100
01:42:37,259 --> 01:42:38,305
But you can reverse it?

1101
01:42:38,401 --> 01:42:40,109
The fear is the most difficult
thing to overcome.

1102
01:42:40,205 --> 01:42:42,924
we are hardwired to remember fear best.

1103
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,843
it is new terrain.

1104
01:42:45,676 --> 01:42:48,298
But we have put together a team.

1105
01:42:48,683 --> 01:42:50,730
I am optimistic.

1106
01:43:16,044 --> 01:43:17,735
Good evening.

1107
01:43:18,508 --> 01:43:23,277
Yesterday, I authorized a covert
rescue mission inside the Capitol.

1108
01:43:23,757 --> 01:43:26,317
I am pleased to announce

1109
01:43:26,413 --> 01:43:30,161
that the Victors have been liberated!

1110
01:43:35,404 --> 01:43:39,479
Let this day mark an historic change.

1111
01:43:40,205 --> 01:43:43,469
With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,

1112
01:43:43,565 --> 01:43:47,021
we have sent a clear message
to the Capitol.

1113
01:43:47,117 --> 01:43:51,243
That we will never again
endure injustice.

1114
01:43:56,204 --> 01:44:00,398
Today, a day on which
we reunited family,

1115
01:44:01,069 --> 01:44:03,982
friends, and loved ones.

1116
01:44:04,269 --> 01:44:08,590
Let all of Panem come together.

1117
01:44:09,069 --> 01:44:12,781
Not to battle for the amusement
of the Capitol.

1118
01:44:12,877 --> 01:44:15,691
But to join hands in this fight.

1119
01:44:22,348 --> 01:44:24,909
Let today be the day we promise

1120
01:44:25,101 --> 01:44:26,562
never to give up,

1121
01:44:27,138 --> 01:44:31,405
never to give in
until we have made a new Panem,

1122
01:44:31,501 --> 01:44:35,629
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1123
01:44:35,725 --> 01:44:39,917
And where the districts are free
to share the fruits of their labors

1124
01:44:40,013 --> 01:44:42,379
and not fight one another for scraps!

1125
01:44:55,084 --> 01:45:00,086
This new Panem is on the horizon.
But we must take it for ourselves.

1126
01:45:00,429 --> 01:45:04,525
The road there leads through
the sharp mountains

1127
01:45:04,621 --> 01:45:07,597
and deep ravines of District 2.

1128
01:45:07,692 --> 01:45:11,719
There in the heart of Panemys
steepest mountain range

1129
01:45:11,814 --> 01:45:15,339
lies the Capitol's principal
military facility.

1130
01:45:16,427 --> 01:45:19,085
We can conquer this stronghold

1131
01:45:19,181 --> 01:45:22,253
because we are one people,

1132
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:25,837
one army, one voice.

1133
01:45:25,932 --> 01:45:30,349
Because today is our new beginning.

1134
01:45:30,445 --> 01:45:34,604
Today we have freed the Victors.

1135
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,707
Tomorrow, Panem!

1136
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,483
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

1137
01:45:50,305 --> 01:45:56,171
