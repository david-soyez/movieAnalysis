00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,915
It was fun. It was fun. Yeah.

10
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,750
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

11
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,318
DAVID: So funny.
"Injunctive relief."

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,753
That tickled my funny bone.

13
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,224
What's up, Nick? (SIGHS)

14
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,666
Fucking sucks dick
about Grandma, huh?

15
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,796
Yeah.

16
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,932
Old woman fucking
murdered like that.

17
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,700
Nick, she had cancer.

18
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,669
That's what they
want you to think.

19
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,305
She had cancer for 10 years.

20
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,874
A little too convenient, Jason.

21
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,744
No, it's not, at all.

22
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,512
We'll never know the truth.

23
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,314
We absolutely know the truth.
Yeah.

24
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,216
Grandma had cancer
for 10 years.

25
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,285
You don't just die
from cancer, Jason!

26
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,920
It's a conspiracy, man.

27
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,656
Just like 9/11.

28
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,226
Oh, God.

29
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,228
For your information,
Grandma is not right here.

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,931
Grandma is gone and she
was taken from us.

31
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,732
And we must find the man that did this.
Nick! Nick!

32
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,534
Stop it. Ow, man!

33
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,369
There are Rockport's.

34
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,571
Fuck, man. I just got these.

35
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,838
(NICK SCOFFS) Calm down...

36
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,607
I'll see you at the
crossroads, Grandma.

37
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,609
What are you doing? Are you kidding me?
Right now?

38
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,378
Hey, get your shit together!

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,947
My dad and my fiancee

40
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,715
are literally standing
right next to us.

41
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,584
Beyonce's here? No.

42
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,785
Your dad and fiancee are
saying yes to Beyonce?

43
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,353
What? No.

44
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,754
Is Jay-Z here, too? No, Nick.

45
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,723
Is Blue Ivy here? Nick. (SIGHS)

46
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,845
I'm in the minority. I think
their kid's gonna be hot.

48
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,476
What is that? Hmm?

49
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,698
What are you doing? I'm just...

50
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,632
Are you fucking high right now?

51
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,367
No, this isn't...

52
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,236
You're high as a kite!
It's an e-cigarette.

53
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,837
It's filled with a little weed,
but it's an e-cigarette.

54
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,606
Grow up, man!
What are you doing?

55
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,609
"Grow up"? How adult are you?

56
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,978
What, do you listen
to NPR in your Volvo?

57
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,879
You play racquetball
competitively

58
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,748
against business associates?
No. No.

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,950
You ever go away to a rented
house with other couples

60
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,685
and then play <i>Scattergories
</i> over a bottle of white wine?

61
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,808
Jason.

62
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,123
(STAMMERS) Uh...

63
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,991
(EXHALING)

64
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,794
I just blew a shot
at your grandma's memory.

65
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,429
Nick, get it together, right now.
(INHALES)

66
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,431
Lock it up.

67
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,404
I'm not hugging you.

68
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,156
If I hug you, will you
stop messing around?

69
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,281

(GASPING)
Crop-dusted, motherfucker.

72
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,286
You just got crop-dusted.

73
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,654
You're high now.
You're high now.

74
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,289
Hey. Get the fuck away from me.

75
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,056
Now we're both high at Grandma's funeral.
(COUGHING)

76
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,675
We're bonded for life.

77
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,636
Uncle Dave, I'm sorry, man. It's a
tough day. (CONTINUES COUGHING)

86

to the rehearsal brunch Sunday.

87
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,397
Do you like the coral
color or the salmon?

Coral or salmon?

93
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,642
Well, what do you like?

94
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,478
I mean... I like the coral.

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
That's what
I was going to say, too.

96
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,636
Okay, cool. Okay. Okay.

97
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,332
Coral it is!

98
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,055

00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,533
Anyway, I'm down
in Valdosta right now.

102
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,101
I opened up
a fucking pet shop...

103
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,536
Not pet shop, "puppy mill."

104
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,138
Puppy mill...

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,807
You know, designer dogs
get a bad name,

106
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,776
but they can go
for quite a pretty penny.

107
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,811
Really? It's just hard
to get them to mate.

108
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,613
Oh. Because the little dogs,

109
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,681
they don't wanna
fuck the big dogs,

110
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,750
and the big dogs, they don't
wanna fuck the little dogs...

111
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,520
So I got to manually
do it, you know. Oh.

112
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,022
I got to spread
and manually shoot in.

113
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,924
Uh-huh. So, what's up with you?

114
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,492
Well, I'm keeping
pretty busy...

115
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,528
Cool. Hey, Aunt Diane,

116
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,762
how's it going? Hi, Nick.

117
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,197
Hey, Nick.

118
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,032
I just don't understand
why you have to drive

119
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,634
down to Florida,
tomorrow already, Dad!

120
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,068
We just had the funeral.

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,969
Your grandmother
and I were there

122
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,438
at this time every year.

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,806
It's what
she would have wanted.

124
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,474
I'd drive down myself,

125
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,476
except they took
my license away.

126
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,711
But why does Jason have
to be the one to drive you?

127
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,079
He's so busy at work...

128
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,548
Got the wedding
coming up next weekend,

129
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,882
the rehearsal brunch.

130
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,485
You know, the entire law
firm is coming to this.

131
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,554
It's true, Grandpa. Jason...

132
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,796
We have a lot of stuff, Meredith and I...
I'll handle it.

133
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,691
JASON: Go ahead.

134
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,494
How about Cousin Nick?
Huh, Dad?

135
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,529
Why doesn't Nick do it?

136
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,097
We got this chocolate Lab
down at the store

137
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,899
that is just so horny,

138
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,668
every time I touch
the back of its ear,

139
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,770
it just gushes cum.

140
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,839
Uh, okay. I mean,
like a squirting...

141
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,841
Is that your dog?

142
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,175
Nick isn't legally allowed

143
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,944
to leave the state
of Georgia anymore.

144
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,246
I've barely seen this guy
since high school.

145
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,114
What's wrong with spending
some time with him?

146
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,683
Oh, so spending time
with family

147
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,751
is suddenly important
to you now?

148
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,687
Look, he can come here tomorrow
morning for breakfast.

149
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,255
We can drive down
to Boca during the day,

150
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,624
maybe play a round
of golf or two,

151
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,593
then he'd be back here
in Atlanta the next day.

152
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,928
He can't just
flake off for two days!

153
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,730
The risk versus reward
here is just...

154
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,799
I don't see it happening.

155
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,161
(SIGHS) It's what she would
have wanted, that's all.

156
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,572
But if you have to get
ready for your wedding,

157
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,040
if you're that busy...

158
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:39,985
I just don't understand
why he wants you to take him.

159
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,653
You're not even that close.

160
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,722
Well, we used to be.

161
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,890
Grandpa and I got along
growing up.

162
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,925
We used to build these

163
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,894
model trains every Christmas,
so I brought him...

164
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,961
Well, it seems like
we're cutting it

165
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,696
a little close here, you know,

166
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,764
with the rehearsal
brunch on Friday...

167
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,633
I know. I know.

168
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,601
And by the way,
I can't find any

169
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,603
of the Martha's Vineyard
vacation photos

170
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,804
for the slide show. (SIGHS)

171
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,139
I'm just freaking out.

172
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,674
That's because
they're on my laptop,

173
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,075
which I've got right here.

174
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,243
So I'll send them
to the wedding planner.

175
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,045
You don't have to worry

Thanks. Oh, and your dad says take
75, because 16 takes forever.

Yeah, I know. He's got
it all mapped out for me.

my car, sweetie?

you'd be doing that.

worked out better.

Because it's just
that I remember

232
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,031
when you were in high school,

233
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,799
you told me how much you
wanted to be a photographer,

234
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,035

That sort of thing.

235

I got you that subscription

237
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,742
Yeah, I used to be into
photography, but, um...

238
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,910
I mean, with Dad being
at the firm, pfft,

239
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,445
it just made so much more sense

240
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,247
to focus on
a college curriculum

241
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,949

the law school track.

Grandpa in the garage, so...

of the saw on the face.

00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,277
(LAUGHS)

1046
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:12,248
Pam! Pam! FINCH: My God.
He is just a good one.

1047
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,951
He is the number one...
Lover and a fighter...

1048
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,085
Okay, listen.

1049
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:21,057
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

1050
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,892
I'm being completely honest
from the bottom of my heart,

1051
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:26,396
I look up to you.
I fight for the law.

1052
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:27,864
Thank you. No one ever
says that to us. Ever.

1053
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,746
That's what I wanted to do
when I was a kid.

1054
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,135
I wanna do what you guys do.

1055
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:36,105
Mostly people just call us pigs and
throw bags of fast food at us.

1056
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:39,175
I'm incredibly sorry for all this
confusion, but listen to me,

1057
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,178
please, I have to
let you know I'm a lawyer.

1058
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,781
Whoa, whoa! You're a lawyer?
Wait a second.

1059
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,282
Yeah, I'm actually a lawyer.

1060
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,985
Whoa. You don't look
like a lawyer. No.

1061
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,107
Yeah, I handle, like,
uh, corporate stuff.

1062
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:55,458
Like, uh, like LLC agreements.

1063
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,927
LP... You lost me. I don't
even know what that means.

1064
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,264
I mean, you don't look Jewish.
No.

1065
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,099
(SIGHS) If you think about it,
it's actually pretty funny.

1066
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,967
(LAUGHING)

1067
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,402
Like, ending up here
on this side...

1068
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,764
It is. That is funny.
It is so weird.

1069
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:11,708
It's darkly ironic.
It really is.

1070
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,210
Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

1071
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,313
I thought you had to be, like,
at least 80 to be a lawyer.

1072
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,015
(SCOFFS) Lawyer. Like, it's
a lot of school, right?

1073
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,316
Yeah.

1074
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,185
(STAMMERS)
It's a lot of school.

1075
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,721
The bar...

1076
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,023
It's something I took
and passed.

1077
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,758
It's not something
I stand behind.

1078
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,460
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1079
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:32,295
I'm not on this side,
typically,

1080
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,063
and I just, uh... I just...

1081
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,800
I know my rights and
I would love my phone call.

1082
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:39,335
Objection. Overruled.

1083
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,804
Permission to approach the bench.
Denied!

1084
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,372
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) What?

1085
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,414
It's easy to be a lawyer.
It's so easy.

1086
00:45:45,757 --> 00:45:47,477
(STAMMERING)
I would love my phone call.

1087
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,511
(BOTH MOCKING)

1088
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:50,480
Okay?

1089
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,248
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.

1090
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,050
(BOTH CONTINUE MOCKING)
Give me my phone call.

1091
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:55,351
I should have a phone...

1092
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,370
This is my
First Amendment right.

1093
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:59,388
It is my first... First and foremost...
Page one, number one...

1094
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,923
amendment says that
I get my telephone.

1095
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,391
And most of all,
can I get a phone call?

1096
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,393
This is my
First Amendment right.

1097
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,428
(MOCKINGLY) I don't think you understand
that I'm guaranteed a phone call.

1098
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,264
I don't sound like that.

1099
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,366
(MOCKINGLY) Yeah?
What do you sound like then?

1100
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,367
Um, not like that. I don't
think I sound like that.

1101
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,035
(BOTH CONTINUE MOCKING)

1102
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,789
Give me my phone call.

1103
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,407
Oh, please, will you let me have
my phone call? ...phone call.

1104
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,911
I'm an American and
I'm fucking guaranteed...

1105
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:23,546
I'm an American.

1106
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,548
I am guaranteed a phone call.

1107
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,110
(MOCKINGLY) Legally, it's my
right to have a phone call.

1108
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,054
I just said I'm an American

1109
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,990
and I'm guaranteed
a phone call.

1110
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,225
Hmm. Well, now
he's getting demanding.

1111
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,994
Yeah. We better give
him his phone call.

1112
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,128
(MOCKINGLY) Better
give him his phone call.

1113
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,963
Guys, come on. Come on, please.

1114
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,132
It doesn't...
Why are we doing this?

1115
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,901
This is your phone
right here, right?

1116
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,003
That is my phone. Yes.

1117
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,805
Well, you know what?

1118
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,073
We get to make one phone
call on your phone.

1119
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,942
That's where you're just
a little bit mixed up.

1120
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,844
Yeah. Hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

1121
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:56,979
No, no, no, no, no... Yeah, we
get a free Uber ride on that.

1122
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,548
Go ahead. Take us out to lunch.

1123
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,416
Hey, you know what? We're gonna
be kind and set you up with

1124
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,118
a Tinder account too.

1125
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,219
OFFICER REITER: Ooh, how about Grindr.
What about...

1126
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,319
OFFICER FINCH: Look at
this, look at this.

1127
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,419
"Jefe", is that how
you pronounce that?

1128
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,923
Yeah, how about Jefe?

1129
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,325
Yeah. Huh? Little
alone time with Jefe?

1130
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,195
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting, flirting...

1131
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,896
Flirtations.

1132
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,681
OFFICER REITER: Hmm.
He looks thick and lonely.

1133
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:17,465
OFFICER FINCH: You'll meet him at 8:00.
You'll bring wine coolers.

1134
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,001
And...

1135
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,465
Children's condoms. (LAUGHS)

1136
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,241
Just gonna take a little picture.
Oh.

1137
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:26,909
Snatch-chat.
Yeah, a little snach-chat.

1138
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,177
Please don't do that
with my phone.

1139
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,478
Hope you got a wide
angle lens on that.

1140
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,200
Oh! Wow. (PHONE RINGING)

1141
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,416
(CHUCKLES)

1142
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:34,418
Kidding.

1143
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:39,889
Somebody just posted his bail.
Get that pervert some pants.

1144
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:42,024
OFFICER FINCH: All right.

1145
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,160
These were a couple
pair of pants

1146
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:49,298
from murder victims from
a 1990s orgy gone bad.

1147
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,820
We got semen-stained
or blood-stained.

1148
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,623
Take your pick.
What's it gonna be?

1149
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,974
Blood. Semen it is.

1150
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,044
Hey, there he is. No.

1151
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,348
Don't even fucking talk to me.

1152
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,984
Oh. Look, I know things
got a little chaotic,

1153
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,652
but I'm so close with Lenore...

1154
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,520
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1155
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,123
I'm about to get fucking
married, Grandpa!

1156
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,025
In one week! To a Jewish girl!

1157
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,127
And I just woke up
in fucking jail

1158
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:21,230
with a bunch of penises
on my forehead

1159
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,073
in the shape of a swastika!

1160
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,582
Could call it a swasticock.

1161
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,238
What? It's a play on words.

1162
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,321
Oh, it's a play on words.

1163
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:32,676
A play on words.

1164
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,913
Play on these words.

1165
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,180
I'm dropping you off

1166
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,683
at your old army vet
buddy's house,

1167
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,985
he's gonna drive you
to fucking Boca.

1168
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:44,627
Because I'm fucking
done with you.

1169
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:49,392
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1170
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,635
I can't help
staring at your tits.

1171
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,696
Pow!

1172
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,418
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1173
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,672
You know, Stinky
had more confirmed kills

1174
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:06,275
than anyone in our platoon
back in 'Nam? 118.

1175
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,557
Shut the fuck up.

1176
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,980
What is this place?

1177
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,515
I don't know. Or care.

1178
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:14,050
At least just come in with me.

1179
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,492
Let's make sure
it's the right house.

1180
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,686
After you.

1181
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,270
Grandson of the year.

1182
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,765
Your grandmother's
ashes are in there.

1183
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,536
She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

1184
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,114
<i>Oh, well,
better late than never.</i>

1185
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,637
Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

1186
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:36,813
Motherfucker!

1187
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,109
Stinky?

1188
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,312
What the fuck are you
doing here, Dick?

1189
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,246
Oh, this?

1190
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,983
Nah, this is liver failure.

1191
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,188
Who's the lesbian?

1192
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,230
That's my grandson, Jason.

1193
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,591
Yeah?

1194
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,094
Is he here to scissor with me?

1195
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:59,695
Okay, that's just
offensive to lesbians.

1196
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:02,131
I am very sorry, k.d. lang.

1197
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,568
Time for Bingo!

1198
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,370
Come on. Stinky, we got to get
you the fuck out of here.

1199
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,005
Come on, let's go.

1200
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:12,408
Uh, I got one fucking
month left, Dick!

1201
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,511
I don't want you to
remember me like this, man.

1202
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,480
I want you to remember
me as a warrior.

1203
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:20,149
Please. Leave me be.
But, Stinky...

1204
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,271
No, no, no...
Just let me finish, Dick.

1205
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,389
Leave me your beautiful
lesbian grandson

1206
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,592
so he can blowjob me to death.

1207
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,383
It's all over for me, Dick.

1208
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:38,401
You know, all I wanna
do is play Bingo.

1209
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,570
Go.

1210
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:43,953
NURSE: All ready?

1211
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,645

01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:16,391
<i>♪ Through it all</i>

1728
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:20,395
<i>♪ You were my strength
when I was weak</i>

1729
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:23,898
<i>♪ You were my voice
when I couldn't speak</i>

1730
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,969
<i>♪ You were my eyes
when I couldn't see</i>

1731
01:13:27,971 --> 01:13:31,472
<i>♪ You saw the best
there was in me</i>

1732
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:35,510

1733

1734
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:42,750
<i>♪ I'm everything I am.</i>

1735
01:13:45,648 --> 01:13:46,888
Damn!

1736
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,791
<i>♪ Because you loved me ♪</i>

1737
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:55,731
(EXHALES)

1738
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,700
Who are you?

1739
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,973
SHADIA: I'm just saying,
who sings that well

1740
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,809
and isn't
a professional singer?

1741
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:10,478
You're so good at singing
you actually suck!

1742
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,013
You guys want to come up
for a nightcap?

1743
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:13,214
Yeah, well...

1744
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,883
See if shit gets real?

1745
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,555
Well, uh, young
Michael Buble and I

1746
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,838
are gonna have a stogie
by the pool, so...

1747
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,007
Okay.

1748
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,589
See you up there? Yeah.

1749
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:35,036
I want you to know
how much I appreciate

1750
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:37,438
you doing this for me, Jason.

1751
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:40,508
The greatest gift a grandson
can give his grandfather

1752
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,976
is a hot college girl who

1753
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,378
wants to have unprotected sex
with him before he dies.

1754
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:48,883
Yeah, well, most grandpas
just want toffee.

1755
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,187
(SIGHS)

1756
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,469
What's the matter?

1757
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:58,399
I think I'm gonna
call off my wedding.

1758
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:06,000
Well, when you get married,
it's for a long fucking time.

1759
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,282
And it's hard.

1760
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,271
So it damn well
better be with a woman

1761
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:12,514
who keeps things interesting.

1762
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:14,175
You know your grandmother,

1763
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,418
she tried to grow
her own pot plant once?

1764
01:15:17,286 --> 01:15:19,046
Really? Yeah,

1765
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,248
she just wanted to see
if she could do it.

1766
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,050
(LAUGHS)

1767
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:26,693
She was always
surprising me like that.

1768
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,424
We also tried anal
once every five years.

1769
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,161
Sweet.

1770
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:38,105
I miss having someone
to share everything with.

1771
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:42,303
It's not fair
to just keep Shadia

1772
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:43,538
in the dark like this.

1773
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:48,109
Since we started this,
it's just been one big lie.

1774
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:49,192
She has no idea who I am.

1775
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,487
I have to tell her the truth.

1776
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,684
Uh, well, maybe telling her
tonight is a little abrupt.

1777
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,121
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

1778
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:02,123
That's right.

1779
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,759
And I'm going to start now.

1780
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:07,328
Or you can just wait till I
have sex with Lenore tonight,

1781
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,850
then you can tell
Shadia everything.

1782
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,832
No. I'm just lying.

1783
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:14,735
Jason, I'm your grandfather!

1784
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,137
You wait till I fuck
that college girl!

1785
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:18,139
I'm telling her now. Jason...

1786
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,074
Jason! Jason!

1787
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,309
Jason!

1788
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,511
Jason!

1789
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:25,980
(LAUGHS)

1790
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:26,982
'Sup, brah?

1791
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:31,686
Back off, D cups!

1792
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,755
Well, if it isn't
the "Professor."

1793
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,958
You know, it's amazing
what you can find

1794
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,359
with a name and
Google these days.

1795
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:40,628
You're not a real professor?

1796
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,997
Oh, my God! You lied to us.
How could you.

1797
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,966
Wait, wait, wait,
this is the best part.

1798
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:46,248
This is the best part.

1799
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:50,371
Richard "Dick" Kelly,
Lieutenant Colonel

1800
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,653
in the United States Army,

1801
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:57,044
also known as the American
Gladiator "Nitro."

1802
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,879
What the fuck did you Google?

1803
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:01,716
Okay, well, there's
another best part then.

1804
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:08,322
"Jason Patrick Kelly will wed
Meredith Miriam Goldstein"

1805
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:12,059
"at Jericho Temple
on Saturday, March 27th."

1806
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:16,330
Oh, wait, that's,
um, next Saturday.

1807
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:19,967
Wait, you're grandfather
and grandson?

1808
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,169
Oh, my God!
That is so fucked up.

1809
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,571
That is so hot. I mean,
that is so fucked up.

1810
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:28,943
So...

1811
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,815
Are you getting married
next weekend?

1812
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,770
I was. I was getting married,

1813
01:17:35,779 --> 01:17:38,219
but then I met you,
and now I don't...

1814
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:39,822
Oh, my God!
No. Don't pull that shit.

1815
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,759
(VOICE BREAKING) I feel fucking
stupid enough as it is.

1816
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:51,699
So you're not a professor?
Are you even a photographer?

1817
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:52,967
I'm a lawyer.

1818
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,201
(LAUGHS)

1819
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:57,873
I handle SEC compliance.

1820
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:00,741
LLC agreements.

1821
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:01,976
I came up here to...

1822
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:03,978
Get the fuck out, Jason.
Seriously.

1823
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:04,445
Can I have a second to explain?

1824
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,180
No!

1825
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,149
Hold up, hold up.
Not so fast, "Professor."

1826
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:12,887
For what's it worth,

1827
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,455
I still really
want to fuck you.

1828
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:16,691
And we're going to fuck.
Yeah, we are.

1829
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:17,858
We're going to thunder fuck.

1830
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,421
You're gonna
tsunami on my face!

1831
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,163
You're gonna
flood like the Nile.

1832
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,699
Yeah. I guess the drought
in my pussy is finally over.

1833
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,434
The villagers will finally eat.

1834
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:27,968
You're gonna die
while you're eating me out.

1835
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,771
I want your last breath
to be in my pussy.

1836
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:31,038
Lenore! You're such a slut.

1837
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,740
BOTH: Police! Shit!

1838
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:34,742
That's right.
Po-po in the ho-ho.

1839
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,310
OFFICER REITER:
Some kind of ganja party?

1840
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:37,945
Sorry to harsh your mellows.

1841
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:39,747
OFFICER FINCH:
Where's my e-vite?

1842
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:41,082
Is that the jacket? Check the
right coat pocket. Check it, man.

1843
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:42,349
Okay, turn around. Come on.

1844
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:43,984
That's my jacket.
That's not his jacket.

1845
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,419
OFFICER FINCH: Up against
the palm. There you go.

1846
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,853
Let's have a look.
What've you got in here? Huh?

1847
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,856
Bingo-bango. OMG.

1848
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,091
What the fuck? That's not mine!

1849
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:52,860
"What the fuck?"
That's not mine!

1850
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:54,295
The fuck? Well, it looks
like Spring Break

1851
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,397
is finally drug free!

1852
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,765
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, pretty boy.

1853
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:59,500
Oh, shall we?

1854
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,736
No, it doesn't go down
that way. Let's go.

1855
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,170
I'll wait for you, Grandpa.

1856
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,905
DICK: Keep that shit
tight for me!

1857
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,187
He's my Henry Miller.

1858
01:19:07,629 --> 01:19:08,909
What the fuck does that mean?

1859
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,144
Exactly!

1860
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,812
(DOOR BUZZING)

1861
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,516
Hey, there he is.

1862
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:17,485
You got blood on your
pants, you know.

1863
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:19,487
Your license isn't
even suspended, is it?

1864
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:21,322
You made all this up just so
I'd come down here with you.

1865
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:23,444
I had to make sure you'd come.

1866
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,392
Fuck you!

1867
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,394
Just chill, Jason.
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

1868
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,166
JASON: Who the fuck are you?

1869
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,801
I should have known
you were fucking crazy

1870
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,236
the moment you started
hitting on women

1871
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:37,171
the day after
Grandma's funeral!

1872
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,073
Don't you fucking judge me.

1873
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,242
You have no idea what I had
with your grandmother.

1874
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:42,510
And everything I've done
these last few days

1875
01:19:42,512 --> 01:19:44,311
I've done for a reason.

1876
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,480
You were about to fuck up
royally by getting married,

1877
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:48,115
and you fucking know it!
Oh, yeah?

1878
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,757
What the fuck am I
supposed to do now?

1879
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,320
Chase around some college girl

1880
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:55,456
that doesn't even want
to fucking talk to me?

1881
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,324
Not know what the fuck I'm
doing for the rest of my life?

1882
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:58,425
Yeah, because at least
you'd be thinking

1883
01:19:58,427 --> 01:19:59,794
for yourself for a change.

1884
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,195
What the fuck
does that even mean?

1885
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,063
Your father has lorded
over every decision

1886
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:04,932
you've made in your adult life,

1887
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:07,168
and Meredith is just
the latest example of that!

1888
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,036
She's not right for you, Jason.

1889
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:10,871
If you marry her, you're
going to be sleepwalking

1890
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:12,173
through the rest of your life
and be completely unhappy,

1891
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:13,541
just like your father!

1892
01:20:13,543 --> 01:20:15,543
I am already
unhappy with my life,

1893
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:19,079
because I've done nothing
but get fucked by you

1894
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,816
and this insane fuck rampage
that you've been on.

1895
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,818
It wasn't a "fuck
rampage" for me.

1896
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,085

That was you who drew

2086
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:09,803

on me last week?

when we were together

it felt great.

by the police, so...

I've got to get out of here.

take my squad car.
