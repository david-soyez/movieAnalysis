2
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,458
Don't move.

3
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,245
I told Batroc...

4
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,746
If we want to make
S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

5
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,184
start sending them bodies now!

6
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,122
I have a bullet for someone...

7
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,323
Move that foot... you want
a bullet in the head...?

8
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,144
I don't like waiting.

9
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,409
Call Durand.

10
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,712
I wanr this ship ready to
move when the ransom comes.

11
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,484
Start the engines.

12
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,041
Shut up.

13
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,686
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

14
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,392
All right, I've
waited long enough...

15
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,725
Find Batroc...

16
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,893
If I don't hear anything
in two minutes...

17
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,294
I start killing them!

18
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,696
I'll find him.

19
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,649
Two minutes.

20
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,415
Radio silence from
S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

21
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,481
Time is up.

22
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,487
Who dies first...?

23
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,619
You!

24
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,021
Get that one.

25
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,309
The line just went dead.

26
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,155
I've lost contact with them...

27
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,615
I thought you were more
than just a shield...

28
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,394
Let's see.

29
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:21,534
I have her. Find him.
