00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:05,817
<i>All right, team,</i>

4
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,018
<i>stay in sight of each other.</i>

5
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,554
<i>Let's make NASA proud today.</i>

6
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,388
<i>How's it looking
over there, Watney?</i>

7
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,891
<i>Well, you'll
be happy to hear...</i>

8
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:15,826
<i>that in Grid Section 14-28,</i>

9
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:18,762
<i>the particles were
predominantly coarse...</i>

10
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,132
but in 29, they're much finer...

11
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,234
and they should be ideal for chem analysis.

12
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,602
<i>Oh, wow. Did
everybody hear that?</i>

13
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,537
<i>Mark just discovered dirt.</i>

14
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:28,806
<i>Should we alert the media?</i>

15
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,774
<i>Sorry, what are
you doing today, Martinez?</i>

16
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,675
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

17
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,911
<i>I'd like you to know</i>

18
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:34,978
<i>that visual inspection
of the equipment...</i>

19
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,679
<i>is imperative to mission success.</i>

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,584
<i>I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.</i>

21
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>Watney,</i>

22
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,185
<i>you keep leaving
your channel open...</i>

23
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:44,155
<i>which leads to
Martinez responding...</i>

24
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,523
<i>which leads to all
of us listening...</i>

25
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:47,157
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

26
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:48,559
<i>Roger that.</i>

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,793
<i>Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...</i>

28
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,995
shut your smart mouth.

29
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,332
We'd prefer to use a different adjective

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,368
to describe Martinez's mouth.

31
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,834
<i>Did Beck just insult me?</i>

32
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,203
<i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

33
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,607
Happy to turn the radios
off from here, Commander.

34
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:03,774
Just say the word.

35
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,209
Wait, Johanssen.

36
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,511
Constant communication is the hallmark...

37
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,779
Shut 'em off.

38
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,879
<i>No.</i>

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,415
No. Excuse me.

40
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,317
<i>I apologize for
my countrymen, Vogel.</i>

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,852
Accepted.

42
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:16,787
How many samples do we need, Commander?

43
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,388
<i>Seven.</i>

44
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,691
<i>100 grams each.</i>

45
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,999
We have a mission update. A storm warning.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,566
<i>Commander, you should come inside.</i>

47
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,802
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

48
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:32,036
What is it?

49
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,304
<i>A storm warning.</i>

50
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,805
I saw that in
this morning's briefing.

51
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,875
We'll be inside before it hits.

52
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:39,844
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

53
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,513
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

54
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:50,022
<i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

55
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,391
<i>Not good.</i>

56
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:58,161
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

57
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,363
That's tracking right towards us.

58
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,065
"Based on current escalation,

59
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,133
"estimated force of 8,600 newtons."

60
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,536
What's the abort force?

61
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,539
7,500.

62
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,574
<i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

63
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:11,976
Do we scrub?

64
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:14,012
Begin abort procedure.

65
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:16,180
We are estimating
with a margin of error.

66
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,147
We could wait it out.

67
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,851
Let's wait it out.

68
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,721
Let's wait it out.

69
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,190
Commander?

70
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:27,692
Prep emergency departure.

71
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,194
Commander?

72
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:31,130
We're scrubbed. That's an order.

73
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,108
<i>Martinez, how long before take-off?</i>

74
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,610
12 minutes.

75
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,281
Visibility is almost zero.

76
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,481
Anyone gets lost,

77
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:52,784
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

78
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,784
You ready?

79
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,487
Ready.

80
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,990
Commander, are you okay?

81
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,658
I'm okay.

82
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,216
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

83
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:28,519
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,988
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.

85
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,524
How?

86
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,125
Use the cables from the
comms mast as guy-lines...

87
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,062
anchor it with the Rover's.

88
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,497
Watch out!

89
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:43,668
Watney!

90
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,604
<i>Warning.
Suit breach detected.</i>

91
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:48,572
What happened?

92
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,740
He was hit.

93
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:50,975
Watney, report.

94
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,810
Before we lost telemetry,

95
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,012
his decompression alarm went off.

96
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:55,012
Where did you last see him?

97
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,312
I don't know where he is.

98
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,113
What are the vitals on his suit?

99
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:58,414
He's offline.

100
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,916
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

101
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,252
- Beck!
- Yeah.

102
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,687
How long can he survive decompression?

103
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,255
Less than a minute.

104
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,757
Line up, walk west.

105
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,861
He may be prone. We
don't wanna step over him.

106
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:12,863
Commander...

107
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,764
We're at 10.5 degrees.

108
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>Warning. Excessive tilt.</i>

109
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,836
Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.

110
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,437
Copy that.

111
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:23,140
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.

112
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,276
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

113
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,877
What about you, Commander?

114
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:29,613
I'm gonna search a
little longer. Get moving!

115
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:30,949
Go!

116
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,053
Watney!

117
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:38,122
Watney, report!

118
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,690
<i>The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.</i>

119
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,125
One good gust and we're tipping.

120
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,627
If it tips, you launch.

121
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,296
You really think I'm
gonna leave you behind?

122
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,363
<i>That's an order, Martinez.</i>

123
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,399
Mark!

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,803
Mark! Can you hear me?

125
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,173
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

126
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,043
Could that detect Watney's suit?

127
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,510
It's made to see
the <i>Hermes</i> from orbit...

128
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,346
not a little piece of
metal from a single suit.

129
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,514
<i>Give it a try.</i>

130
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:04,815
Roger.

131
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,017
What is she thinking? She knows

132
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,250
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

133
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,553
She's grasping for anything.

134
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,421
<i>We've got negative contact</i>

135
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,688
<i>on the proximity radar.</i>

136
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,990
Nothing?

137
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:15,026
<i>No. I can
barely see the Hab.</i>

138
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,128
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

139
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,630
Mark is dead.

140
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,533
<i>Commander!</i>

141
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,002
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?

142
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:26,236
My friend just died.

143
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,604
I don't want my commander to die, too.

144
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:28,873
<i>Stability warning.</i>

145
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,440
We're tipping!

146
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,377
<i>Commander, you need to
get back to the ship, now!</i>

147
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:34,746
13 degrees.

148
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,281
If we pass balance, we'll never rock back.

149
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,515
I've got one more trick left,

150
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,156
and then I'm following orders, Commander.

151
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,853
You're firing the OMS?

152
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,057
That's right.

153
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,661
Commander!

154
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,142
On my way.

155
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,567
<i>Johanssen, let's go.</i>

156
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:06,210
Mark!

157
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,891
<i>We're at 11.5 and holding.</i>

158
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,696
<i>Ready to go on your command.</i>

159
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:28,133
Ready to launch.

160
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,901
Commander.

161
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,636
I need you to verbally
tell me whether or not to.

162
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,939
Launch.

163
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:17,046
<i>At around 4:30 a.m.</i>

164
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:18,614
<i>Central Standard Time...</i>

165
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,917
<i>our satellites detected a storm</i>

166
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,954
<i>approaching the</i> Ares
3<i> mission site on Mars.</i>

167
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:27,724
<i>At 6:45, the storm had
escalated to severe...</i>

168
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,795
<i>and we had no choice but
to abort the mission.</i>

169
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,196
<i>Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...</i>

170
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,666
<i>astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...</i>

171
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,570
<i>were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...</i>

172
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,908
<i>and perform an emergency
launch at 7:28 Central Time.</i>

173
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,810
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...

174
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:50,680
astronaut Mark Watney was
struck by debris and killed.

175
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,984
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team...

176
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:56,420
were able to intercept
safely with the <i>Hermes</i>

177
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,555
and are now heading home.

178
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,425
But Mark Watney is dead.

179
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:02,426
Director Sanders!

180
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,396
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

181
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,105
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

Fuck.

185
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,604
Okay.

186
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,140
<i>Okay.</i>

187
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,180
<i>Hello, this is Mark
Watney, astronaut.</i>

188
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:59,949
<i>I'm entering this
log for the record...</i>

189
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,553
<i>in case I don't make it.</i>

190
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:09,258
<i>It is 06:53 on Sol 19...</i>

191
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,329
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

192
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,964
<i>Obviously.</i>

193
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,501
<i>But I'm guessing that's
gonna come as a surprise</i>

194
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:20,970
<i>to my crewmates and to NASA.</i>

195
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:23,707
<i>And to the entire
world, really, so...</i>

196
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:28,312
<i>Surprise.</i>

197
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,849
<i>I did not die on Sol 18.</i>

198
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,983
<i>Best I can figure...</i>

199
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,219
<i>this length of our primary
communications antenna</i>

200
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,686
<i>broke off...</i>

201
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,922
<i>and tore through my bio-monitor...</i>

202
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,459
<i>and ripped a hole in me as well.</i>

203
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:46,296
<i>But the antenna and
the blood, really,</i>

204
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,498
<i>managed to seal the
breach in my suit...</i>

205
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,200
<i>which kept me alive,</i>

206
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,603
<i>even though the crew must
have thought I was dead.</i>

207
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,073
<i>I have no way to contact NASA.</i>

208
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,041
<i>And even if I could, it's
gonna be four years...</i>

209
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,478
<i>until a manned mission can reach me.</i>

210
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,915
<i>And I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.</i>

211
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,317
<i>If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.</i>

212
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,953
<i>If the water reclaimer
breaks, I'll die of thirst.</i>

213
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,155
<i>If the Hab breaches, I'm
just gonna, kind of...</i>

214
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,490
<i>implode.</i>

215
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:17,427
<i>And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...</i>

216
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,331
<i>eventually I'm gonna
run out of food.</i>

217
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,933
<i>So...</i>

218
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,369
<i>yeah.</i>

219
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,575
<i>Yeah.</i>

220
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,885
I'm not gonna die here.

221
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,061
32...

222
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,596
33...

223
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,900
34...

224
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:11,768
35, 36.

225
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,637
Sweet and sour chicken.

226
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:48,538
What do we got?

227
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,580
<i>Right, let's do the math.</i>

228
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,318
<i>Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.</i>

229
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,952
<i>For redundancy, they sent
68 sols worth of food.</i>

230
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,487
<i>That's for 6 people.</i>

231
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,357
<i>So for just me, that's
gonna last 300 sols...</i>

232
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:10,493
<i>which I figure I can
stretch to 400 if I ration.</i>

233
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:13,664
<i>So I got to figure out a way to grow</i>

234
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>three years' worth of food here.</i>

235
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>On a planet where nothing grows.</i>

236
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,471
<i>Luckily...</i>

237
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,142
<i>I'm a botanist.</i>

238
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:33,017
<i>Mars will come to

00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:19,763
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

240
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,808
<i>Staple came out.</i>

241
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,227
Fuck you, Mars.

242
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,010

248
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,741
<i>The problem is water.</i>

249
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:50,112
I have created 126 square meters of soil.

250
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,247
<i>But every cubic meter
of soil requires</i>

251
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:55,350
<i>40 liters of water to be farmable.</i>

252
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:58,623
<i>So I gotta make a lot more water.</i>

253
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:02,024
<i>Good thing is, I know the recipe.</i>

254
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:04,393
You take hydrogen, you
add oxygen, you burn.

255
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:07,329
<i>Now, I have hundreds of liters</i>

256
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,434
<i>of unused hydrazine at the MDV.</i>

257
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:13,135
<i>If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,</i>

258
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,004
<i>it'll separate into N2 and H2.</i>

259
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:20,175
<i>And then if I just direct the
hydrogen into a small area...</i>

260
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:22,544
<i>and burn it.</i>

261
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:25,615
<i>Luckily, in the
history of humanity...</i>

262
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:27,483
nothing bad has ever happened

263
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,887
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

264
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:32,855
<i>NASA hates fire.</i>

265
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:34,124
<i>Because of the whole</i>

266
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,393
<i>"fire makes everybody
die in space" thing.</i>

267
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,195
<i>So, everything they
sent us up here with</i>

268
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:40,829
<i>is flame-retardant...</i>

269
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,100
with the notable exception of...

270
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:47,203
Martinez's personal items.

271
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:49,572
I am sorry, Martinez.

272
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:51,040
But if you didn't want me
to go through your stuff...

273
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:54,477
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

274
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:55,845
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be

275
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,415
fine with this, given my present situation.

276
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,415
<i>What's
everybody doing?</i>

277
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,349
<i>Taking a holiday from being cool?</i>

278
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,219
Counting on you.

279
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:23,774
Whoo!

280
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,222
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

281
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,791
Best guess...

282
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,131
I forgot to account
for the excess oxygen...

283
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:52,167
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

284
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:54,739
Because I'm stupid.

285
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,375
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...

286
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,313
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

287
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,216
<i>Interesting side note,</i>

288
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:11,186
<i>this is actually how the Jet
Propulsion Lab was founded.</i>

289
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:14,791
<i>Five guys at Caltech were
trying to make rocket fuel...</i>

290
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,225
<i>and they nearly burned
down their dorm.</i>

291
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:17,793
<i>And rather than expel them...</i>

292
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:20,663
<i>they banished them to a nearby farm,</i>

293
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,365
<i>told them to keep working.</i>

294
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:24,900
<i>And now we have a space program.</i>

295
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,906
Okay.

296
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:48,886
Hey, there.

297
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,163
<i>The nation was blessed</i>

298
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:02,432
<i>to have Mark serving
in our space program.</i>

299
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:04,934
<i>While his loss will
be deeply felt...</i>

300
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:07,670
<i>the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...</i>

301
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:10,039
<i>onward and upward in the
mission of their agency.</i>

302
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,274
<i>By doing so, they honor the legacy</i>

303
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,678
<i>Mark's leaving behind...</i>

304
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,481
<i>and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.</i>

305
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,261
<i>I have the honor of speaking</i>

306
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,529
<i>not only for the men
and women of NASA...</i>

307
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,298
<i>but for people all over the world...</i>

308
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,499
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

309
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,070
I need you to authorize my satellite time.

310
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,874
It's not gonna happen.

311
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,876
We're funded for five <i>Ares</i> missions.

312
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,445
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

313
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:50,746
- No.
- <i>Ares 3</i> evac'd after 18 sols.

314
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,781
There's half a mission
worth of supplies up there.

315
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:53,849
I can sell it at a fraction

316
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,650
of the cost of a normal mission...

317
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:58,087
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

318
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,789
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

319
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,791
We've got the <i>Ares 4</i>
supply missions coming up.

320
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,960
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.

321
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:04,993
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.

322
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:06,396
Surely we can spare a few hours...

323
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:08,496
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.

324
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:09,932
We're a public domain organization.

325
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,966
We need to be transparent on this.

326
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,300
Okay.

327
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,070
The second we point the
satellites at the Hab...

328
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,170
I broadcast pictures

329
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,938
of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.

330
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:18,773
You're afraid of a PR problem?

331
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,342
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.

332
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:21,945
Another mission?

333
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,548
Congress won't reimburse
us for a paper clip...

334
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,147
if I put a dead astronaut on the front page

335
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:27,783
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

336
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,685
He's not going anywhere,
Teddy. I mean, he's not...

337
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,655
He's not gonna decompose, you know.

338
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,156
He's gonna be up there forever.

339
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:37,025
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...

340
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:38,962
from normal weather activity within a year.

341
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,897
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

342
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:42,464
<i>Ares 5</i> won't even
launch for five years.

343
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,233
We have plenty of time.

344
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,501
Okay.

345
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,038
Okay.

346
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,008
Okay, consider this.

347
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:55,310
Right now, the world's on our side.

348
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,079
Sympathy for the Watney family.

349
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,448
<i>Ares 6</i> could bring his body home.

350
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:02,351
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...

351
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,352
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.

352
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:06,155
We frame it that way.

353
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,559
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

354
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,261
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

355
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,696
Vincent Kapoor?

356
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:54,470
6-2.

357
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,473
7-6-2.

358
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,512
Acidalia Planitia.

359
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:14,557
What?

360
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,939
Hi. Security?

361
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,908
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

362
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,712
I need the emergency
contact for Vincent Kapoor.

363
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:37,746
Yes, him.

364
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,649
Yes, it's an emergency!

365
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,188
How sure?

366
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:47,923
100%.

367
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,692
You've got to be shitting me.

368
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:52,596
Prove it to me.

369
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:55,598
For a start...

370
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,234
the solar panels have been cleaned.

371
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,802
They could have been cleaned by wind.

372
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:03,339
Back it up. Look at <i>Rover 2.</i>

373
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,572
According to the logs,

374
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:05,675
Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17...

375
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:08,144
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.

376
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:09,878
It's been moved.

377
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,580
She could have forgotten to log the move.

378
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,115
No, not likely.

379
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,450
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

380
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,252
Let's get on CAPCOM and
ask her directly right now.

381
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:17,320
No. No.

382
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:18,654
If Watney is really alive,

383
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,723
we don't want the <i>Ares
3</i> crew to know.

384
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,358
How can you not tell them?

385
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,493
They have another 10
months on their trip home.

386
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:25,828
Space travel is dangerous.

387
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,563
They need to be alert and undistracted.

388
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:28,964
But they already think he's dead.

389
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,999
And they'd be devastated to find out

390
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,167
they left him there alive.

391
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:34,570
I'm sorry, but you
have not thought this through.

392
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:37,740
What are we gonna say? "Dear America...

393
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,475
"remember that astronaut we killed

394
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,109
"and had a really nice funeral for?

395
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,713
"Turns out he's alive and
we left him on Mars. Our bad.

396
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:45,513
"Sincerely, NASA."

397
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:48,082
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

398
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,653
How are we going to handle the public?

399
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:53,656
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

400
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,058
We release a statement with them.

401
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,979
We don't want people
working it out on their own.

402
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:59,195
Yes, sir.

403
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:00,929
But if my math is right,
he's going to starve to death

404
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,565
long before we can help him.

405
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:07,970
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

406
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,805
He's 50 million miles away from home.

407
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,173
He thinks he's totally alone.

408
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,842
He thinks we gave up on him.

409
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:16,445
What does that do to
a man, psychologically?

410
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,849
What the hell is he thinking right now?

411
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:27,022
<i>I'm definitely gonna die up here...</i>

412
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:31,126
<i>if I have to listen to any
more god-awful disco music.</i>

413
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,961
My God, Commander Lewis,

414
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:34,897
couldn't you have packed
anything from this century?

415
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,700
<i>♪ Turn the beat around ♪</i>

416
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,769
No, I am not gonna "turn the beat around."

417
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,405
I refuse to.

418
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:44,172
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

419
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:46,908
What attempts have been made

420
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,743
to make contact with Mark Watney?

421
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:51,013
We're working on it.

422
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,613
Does he have enough supplies to survive?

423
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:54,383
We'll be looking into that.

424
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,718
What does this say about the agency?

425
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,785
Are you gonna resign?

426
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,021
No.

427
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,590
Director Sanders!

428
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,896
<i>It's time to
start thinking long term.</i>

429
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,330
<i>The next NASA mission is</i> Ares 4...

430
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,899
<i>and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

431
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,437
<i>3200 kilometers away.</i>

432
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:19,008
3,200 kilometers.

433
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:21,376
<i>In four years, when the
next</i> Ares <i>crew arrives,</i>

434
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,812
<i>I'll have to be there.</i>

435
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,748
<i>Which means I have
to get to the crater.</i>

436
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:30,051
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

437
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:31,955
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

438
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:35,624
<i>designed to go a max
distance of 35 kilometers...</i>

439
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:39,060
<i>before the battery has to
be recharged at the Hab.</i>

440
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,196
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

441
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:44,566
<i>Problem B is this
journey's gonna take me</i>

442
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:48,002
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

443
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:50,506
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

444
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:52,640
<i>inside a Rover with
marginal life support</i>

445
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:53,976
<i>the size of a small van.</i>

446
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,546
<i>So, in the face of
overwhelming odds,</i>

447
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,283
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

448
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,521
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.</i>

449
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,817
Okay, so, success.

450
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,385
Uh...

451
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:42,726
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

452
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:46,730
But if I use the heater...

453
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,536
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

454
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:57,807
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

455
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:02,410
slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

456
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,914
I would love to solve
this problem right now

457
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:07,749
but unfortunately...

458
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,354
<i>my balls are frozen.</i>

459
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,023
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

460
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,504
<i>Good news, I may have a solution</i>

461
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:30,238
<i>to my heating problem.</i>

462
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,575
<i>Bad news, it involves me digging up</i>

463
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:35,377
<i>the Radioisotope
Thermoelectric Generator.</i>

464
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,580
<i>Now, if I remember my
training correctly,</i>

465
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:39,647
<i>one of the lessons was titled...</i>

466
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:43,017
<i>"Don't Dig Up the Big
Box of Plutonium, Mark."</i>

467
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:45,053
<i>I get it. RTGs are
good for spacecraft,</i>

468
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,888
<i>but if they rupture around humans...</i>

469
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,323
<i>no more humans.</i>

470
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:49,992
<i>Which is why we buried
it when we arrived.</i>

471
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:52,160
<i>And planted that flag...</i>

472
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:53,528
<i>so we would never be stupid enough</i>

473
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:55,831
<i>to accidentally go near it again.</i>

474
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,901
<i>But as long as I don't break it...</i>

475
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,236
<i>I almost just said</i>

476
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,303
<i>"Everything will be fine" out loud.</i>

477
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:04,272
Look, the point is, I'm not cold anymore.

478
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:05,906
And sure, I could choose to think

479
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,309
about the fact that I'm warm...

480
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,345
because I have a decaying

481
00:38:09,346 --> 00:38:11,379
radioactive isotope
riding right behind me...

482
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,149
but right now, I got
bigger problems on my hands.

483
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,551
<i>I have scoured every
single data file</i>

484
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,787
<i>on Commander Lewis' personal drive.</i>

485
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:23,058
<i>This is officially the
least disco song she owns.</i>

00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,995
<i>♪ Lookin'

00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:28,062

<i>♪ I need some hot

<i>♪ I want some hot stuff</i>

<i>♪ I need hot stuff ♪</i>

495
00:38:57,893 --> 00:38:59,627
- Yeah.
- Where is Watney going?

496
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,097
We believe that he's
preparing for a journey.

497
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,298
He's been conducting incremental tests...

498
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:05,801
taking the <i>Rover 2</i> out for longer

499
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,669
and longer trips each time.

500
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,006
To what end? Why would he leave

501
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:12,541
the relative safety of the Hab?

502
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,042
Well, we think that he plans to travel

503
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:15,544
to the <i>Ares 4</i> launch site...

504
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,046
in order to make contact with us,

505
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:18,847
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

506
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,216
<i>But if we could talk to him,</i>

507
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:21,716
<i>we would tell him to stay put...</i>

508
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:24,151
<i>and to trust that we are
doing everything in our power</i>

509
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,254
<i>to bring him home alive.</i>

510
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,157
Thank you very much.

511
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:32,995
Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.

512
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,229
You know what? These
interviews aren't easy.

513
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,832
So God forbid I try to say something

514
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,501
proactive and positive.

515
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,669
Annie.

516
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,403
No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

517
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:45,774
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

518
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,109
Are you asking me?

519
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,144
I am.

520
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:49,678
Yes, sir.

521
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,780
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...

522
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,984
did a short EVA and then
drove for another two.

523
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,685
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

524
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,021
He didn't load up the oxygenator

525
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,622
or the water reclaimer?

526
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:03,457
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

527
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,559
It's just the way the orbits work...

528
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,597
so it's possible that we missed something.

529
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:10,332
I want that gap down to four minutes.

530
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,367
I'm giving you total authority

531
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,537
over satellite trajectories
and orbital adjustments.

532
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,771
Make it happen.

533
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,072
Okay.

534
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,209
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.

535
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,577
So Mark's not going to <i>Ares 4.</i> Yet.

536
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:24,946
But he's smart enough to figure out

537
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:27,383
that's his only chance.

538
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:30,218
Bruce, what's the earliest
we can get a pre-supply there?

539
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,421
<i>With the positions
of Earth and Mars,</i>

540
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:34,557
<i>it'll take nine months.</i>

541
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:37,626
<i>It'll take six months to
build it in the first place.</i>

542
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,059
Three months.

543
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,562
Three?

544
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,696
<i>You're going
to say it's impossible</i>

545
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:43,330
<i>and then I'm gonna make a speech...</i>

546
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,332
<i>about the blinding capabilities</i>

547
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,734
<i>of the JPL team...</i>

548
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,901
<i>and then you're going to do the math</i>

549
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,236
<i>in your head and say
something like...</i>

550
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,305
"The overtime alone will be a nightmare."

551
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:52,173
<i>The overtime alone
will be a nightmare.</i>

552
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:53,374
Get started.

553
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,978
I'll find you the money.

554
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:58,113
We need to tell the crew.

555
00:40:58,114 --> 00:40:59,013
Mitch, we've discussed this.

556
00:40:59,014 --> 00:41:00,816
No, you discussed this.

557
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:04,019
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.

558
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:06,756
They deserve to know.

559
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:10,091
Once there's a real rescue
plan, we'll tell them.

560
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,961
Otherwise, it's moot.

561
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:14,562
Bruce has three months
to get the payload done.

562
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,298
That's all that matters right now.

563
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:18,100
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

564
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,737
Mark dies if you don't.

565
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:26,073
<i>It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.</i>

566
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:28,276
<i>So now it's time
to reap and re-sow.</i>

567
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,912
<i>They grew even better
than I expected.</i>

568
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:34,115
<i>I now have 400
healthy potato plants.</i>

569
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,285
<i>I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.</i>

570
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,888
<i>The smaller ones I'll reseed,</i>

571
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,356
<i>the larger ones are my food supply.</i>

572
00:41:41,357 --> 00:41:45,260
<i>All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.</i>

573
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:48,296
<i>You don't hear that
every day, do you?</i>

574
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,097
<i>And by the way, none of
this matters at all...</i>

575
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:53,235
<i>if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.</i>

576
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,192
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

577
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:46,086
Oh! He's moving again.

578
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:48,691
Where the hell is he going?

579
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,026
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.

580
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,495
He's nowhere near the <i>Ares 4.</i>

581
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:55,463
Unless he's not taking a direct route.

582
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:59,401
He might be trying to avoid some obstacle.

583
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:01,202
What obstacle?

584
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,705
It's Acidalia Planitia.

585
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,474
There's nothing out there except the...

586
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,311
What?

587
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,782
I need a map.

588
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:21,656
Yeah.

589
00:43:21,657 --> 00:43:23,124
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

590
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,158
It's all right. It's all right.

591
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,627
Can I borrow this?

592
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,729
Okay, so where is the Hab location?

593
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,399
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

594
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,633
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

595
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:33,734
- Where's Watney?
- Uh...

596
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:34,903
There.

597
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,205
Okay.

598
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:45,412
Okay. I know where he's going.

599
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:47,149
I need to get on an airplane.

600
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:20,916
Vincent, how are you?

601
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,251
Good to see you.

602
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:23,718
- Good flight?
- Uh...

603
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:25,020
Yeah.

604
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:28,324
It's in storage just around the corner.

605
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:03,892
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.

606
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:05,227
Nice to see you.

607
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:07,595
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

608
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:11,332
It's hard to say. We lost contact in '97.

609
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,568
We think it was battery failure.

610
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:14,836
Though I'd like to point out

611
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,573
it lasted three times longer
than expected in any...

612
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:18,872
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

613
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:20,008
I just need to speak to everybody

614
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,142
that was here in '97.

615
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:22,943
They're already here. Guys.

616
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:24,546
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.

617
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:26,381
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.

618
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:27,483
This is our current team...

619
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,485
and our original project members.

620
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:48,169
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

621
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,472
Okay. Let's see it.

622
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:52,208
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

623
00:45:57,413 --> 00:45:59,215
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

624
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:12,021
Come on. Come on.

625
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:34,443
Holy shit. Okay.

626
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,611
"Broadcasting status.

627
00:47:36,612 --> 00:47:37,879
"Listening for telemetry signal."

628
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,215
Uh-huh.

629
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:42,151
Okay. Signal acquired.

630
00:47:43,418 --> 00:47:44,419
- All right.
- Okay.

631
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,989
Camera.

632
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:37,173
Incoming.

633
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:42,678
"Are you receiving me?"

634
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:45,213
"Yes. No."

635
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,283
Okay, point the camera at "yes."

636
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:51,986
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

637
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,521
All he can do is ask yes or no questions...

638
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:55,656
and all we can do is point the camera.

639
00:48:55,657 --> 00:48:56,825
This won't exactly be
an Algonquin Round Table

640
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:58,160
of snappy repartee.

641
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:00,060
- Are you kidding me?
- Tim, Tim.

642
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:02,296
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that.

643
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:04,666
Pointing the camera.

644
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:17,146
Whoo!

645
00:49:19,114 --> 00:49:20,415
Yes!

646
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:22,851
Yes!

647
00:49:24,286 --> 00:49:26,655
<i>So here's the rub.</i>

648
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:29,091
<i>Somehow we have to have complex</i>

649
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,732
<i>astrophysical engineering
conversations...</i>

650
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:35,763
<i>using nothing but a
still-frame camera...</i>

651
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,699
<i>from 1996.</i>

652
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,371
<i>Luckily...</i>

653
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,406
<i>the camera does spin.</i>

654
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,676
So I can make an alphabet.

655
00:49:48,677 --> 00:49:50,611
It can't be our alphabet.

656
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,115
26 characters plus a question card

657
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,584
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

658
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:57,184
That's way too narrow.

659
00:49:57,185 --> 00:49:59,855
I'd never know what the
camera was pointing at.

660
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,730
Ooh.

661
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,536
Hexadecimals.

662
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,807
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

663
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,242
<i>I figured one of you guys</i>

664
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:23,477
<i>kept an ASCII table lying around.</i>

665
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,778
<i>And I was right.</i>

666
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:26,080
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

667
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:29,651
<i>I give you super-nerd
Beth Johanssen.</i>

668
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,687
<i>Who also had copies of</i> Zork II...

669
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:35,490
<i>and</i> Leather Goddesses of
Phobos <i>on her personal laptop.</i>

670
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:38,426
<i>Seriously, Johanssen...</i>

671
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:41,196
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.

672
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:43,298
- <i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>
- Yes!

673
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:45,501
<i>Who am I to talk about loneliness?</i>

674
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:07,789
I know where he's going with this.

675
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,838
"F, O."

676
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,841
"7, W."

677
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,593
Vincent.

678
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,662
Vincent, wake up.

679
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:35,809
<i>Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...</i>

680
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,079
<i>the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions</i>

681
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,814
<i>on how to hack the Rover...</i>

682
00:52:39,815 --> 00:52:42,082
<i>so that it can talk to</i> Pathfinder.

683
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,251
<i>If I hack a tiny bit of code...</i>

684
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:47,488
<i>just 20 instructions in the
Rover's operating system...</i>

685
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:49,024
<i>NASA can link the
Rover to</i> Pathfinder's

<i>broadcasting frequency...</i>

687
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:53,628
<i>and we're in business.</i>

688
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:08,075
"Mark...

689
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:10,912

<i>"Meantime, we're putting

695
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,534
"to keep you fed until
<i>Ares 4</i> arrives."

696
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:50,552
Okay.

697
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:01,496
Okay.

698
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,599
"Glad to hear it. Really
looking forward to not dying."

699
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:18,613
"How's the crew?"

700
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:21,384
"What did they say when
they found out I was alive?"

701
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,671
Guys, can we get some space please?

702
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:45,740
Me?

703
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,075
Yeah, you.

704
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,677
Give me a sec.

705
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:56,619
Just tell him.

706
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:11,199
"We haven't told the
crew you are alive yet.

707
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:17,206
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

708
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:32,188
What the fuck?

709
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:34,123
What the fuck?

710
00:55:41,364 --> 00:55:44,097
Okay, he says, "They don't know I'm alive?

711
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:46,066
"What the..." F-word.

712
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:47,434
F-word in gerund form.

713
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:49,037
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"

714
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:55,176
"Mark, please watch your language.

715
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,345
"Everything you type

716
00:55:57,346 --> 00:56:01,684
"is being broadcast
live all over the world."

717
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,221
Yeah?

718
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:14,595
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

719
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,599
Yes, sir.

720
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,702
He is under a tremendous amount of stress.

721
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:23,398
I understand. We're working on it.

722
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,872
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

723
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:27,609
Thank you, Mr. President.

724
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,678
Problem is, Mark's right.

725
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,046
The longer we wait, the
worse it's gonna get.

726
00:56:33,047 --> 00:56:34,615
We need to tell the crew.

727
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:37,283
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...

728
00:56:37,284 --> 00:56:39,019
so he can't argue the other side.

729
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,555
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.

730
00:56:40,556 --> 00:56:42,291
Or anyone else.

731
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,061
It's time, Teddy.

732
00:57:09,951 --> 00:57:11,519
<i>Commander Lewis?</i>

733
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,788
Go ahead.

734
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:15,223
<i>Data dump
is almost complete.</i>

735
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:18,326
Copy that. On my way.

736
00:57:31,105 --> 00:57:32,606
You're in a hurry.

737
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:34,109
Yeah.

738
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,144
My son turned three yesterday.

739
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:38,079
Should be pictures of the party.

740
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:50,457
Got a batch of personals.

741
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:52,795
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

742
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:57,231
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

743
00:57:57,232 --> 00:57:59,233
They're telemetry updates.

744
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:00,634
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

745
00:58:01,904 --> 00:58:03,370
There's a video message.

746
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:05,506
It's addressed to the whole crew.

747
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:08,242
Play it. Come on, guys.

748
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:09,910
I wanna get in on
that telemetry action.

749
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:17,051
<i>Hi, hello. It's Mitch.
Mitch Henderson.</i>

750
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:19,220
<i>I have some news.</i>

751
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:22,490
<i>There's no subtle way to put this.</i>

752
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:24,559
<i>Mark Watney is still alive.</i>

753
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,593
Oh, my God.

754
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:28,829
<i>I know that's a surprise and I know</i>

755
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,363
<i>you will have a lot of questions.</i>

756
00:58:30,364 --> 00:58:33,334
<i>But here are the basics.</i>

757
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,971
<i>He's alive and he's healthy.</i>

758
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,408
<i>We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.</i>

759
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:42,876
- Two months?
- Oh, my God.

760
00:58:42,877 --> 00:58:45,713
<i>I was strongly
against that decision.</i>

761
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:48,716
<i>We're telling you now because...</i>

762
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:51,385
<i>we finally have
communication with him...</i>

763
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:54,521
<i>and a viable rescue plan.</i>

764
00:58:54,522 --> 00:58:56,557
<i>We'll give you a write-up
of what happened,</i>

765
00:58:56,558 --> 00:58:58,124
<i>a full write-up of everything.</i>

766
00:58:58,125 --> 00:58:59,827
<i>But it's not your fault.</i>

767
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,697
<i>Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.</i>

768
00:59:03,364 --> 00:59:06,134
<i>So... Yeah...</i>

769
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,537
<i>Take some time to absorb this.</i>

770
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:13,240
<i>And send all the questions you want.</i>

771
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:14,943
<i>We'll answer them.</i>

772
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:18,146
<i>All right. Henderson out.</i>

773
00:59:18,147 --> 00:59:20,048
Holy shit, he's alive.

774
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,216
I left him behind.

775
00:59:22,217 --> 00:59:23,251
- No.
- No.

776
00:59:23,252 --> 00:59:25,086
We all left together.

777
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:27,021
You were following orders.

778
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,760
I left him behind.

779
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,303
<i>So now that
NASA can talk to me,</i>

780
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:45,106
<i>they won't shut up.</i>

781
00:59:45,107 --> 00:59:47,876
<i>They want constant updates
on every Hab system...</i>

782
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,609
<i>and they got a room full of people</i>

783
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,579
<i>trying to micromanage my crops.</i>

784
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,315
<i>Which is awesome.</i>

785
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,484
<i>Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...</i>

786
00:59:56,485 --> 01:00:01,123
<i>but I am the greatest
botanist on this planet, so...</i>

787
01:00:02,324 --> 01:00:03,825
<i>One big bonus</i>

788
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:05,827
<i>to this communication
with NASA again...</i>

789
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:07,461
<i>is the email. I'm
getting them again.</i>

790
01:00:07,462 --> 01:00:09,830
<i>Big data dumps like when
I was on the</i> Hermes.

791
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:11,899
<i>I even got one from the president.</i>

792
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,568
<i>The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...</i>

793
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,803
<i>was from University of Chicago,</i>

794
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:17,571
<i>my alma mater.</i>

795
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,240
They say that once you
grow crops somewhere...

796
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,243
you've officially colonized it.

797
01:00:22,944 --> 01:00:25,347
<i>So, technically...</i>

798
01:00:26,214 --> 01:00:28,115
<i>I colonized Mars.</i>

799
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:34,823
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

800
01:00:35,623 --> 01:00:37,457
In other news, there's been a request...

801
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,193
for me to pose for a photograph

802
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:41,362
on my next transmission.

803
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,530
I'm trying to figure out whether

804
01:00:43,531 --> 01:00:46,399
I should go with "High School Senior"...

805
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,505
or "coquettish ingenue."

806
01:00:51,406 --> 01:00:52,807
But I'm not really sure

807
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,528
how that's gonna look with my spacesuit on.

808
01:01:20,335 --> 01:01:21,870
Hey!

809
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:25,872
What is he doing?

810
01:01:25,873 --> 01:01:28,142
I asked for a photo,
and what, he's The Fonz?

811
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,943
<i>Just be grateful we got
you something, Annie.</i>

812
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:32,113
I can't use this,
Vincent, and you know that.

813
01:01:32,114 --> 01:01:33,613
I need a picture of his face.

814
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:35,349
<i>I could tell him to
take off his helmet...</i>

815
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,917
but then he'd, you know, die, so...

816
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,620
<i>We'll release the photo</i>

817
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:40,921
<i>when we detail the rescue operation.</i>

818
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:42,756
I want to announce we're launching

819
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:44,057
some supplies to him next year...

820
01:01:44,058 --> 01:01:46,260
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

821
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:48,629
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?

822
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,564
<i>It'll be tight, but we'll make it.</i>

823
01:01:50,565 --> 01:01:52,466
Nine-month travel time.

824
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,934
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

825
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:57,037
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

826
01:01:57,038 --> 01:02:00,542
<i>Yeah, they estimate Mark's
crops will last till Sol 912.</i>

827
01:02:00,543 --> 01:02:03,077
<i>They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.</i>

828
01:02:03,078 --> 01:02:04,410
Grudgingly?

829
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:05,446
<i>Yeah. Mark has a
tendency to tell them</i>

830
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:06,680
<i>to have sex with themselves...</i>

831
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,649
<i>whenever they question
one of his decisions.</i>

832
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,751
Get him in line, Vincent.

833
01:02:09,752 --> 01:02:11,651
We can't afford any miscommunication.

834
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:13,321
I hate this margin.

835
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:17,025
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.

836
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:20,329
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

837
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:08,108
<i>Suit breach detected.</i>

838
01:03:15,717 --> 01:03:18,452
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

839
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:34,669
<i>Oxygen level, 10%.</i>

840
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,019
<i>Oxygen level, 5%.</i>

841
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,297
<i>Suit pressure, stable.</i>

842
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:01,282
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

843
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,719
God! God, God, God, God!

844
01:06:56,438 --> 01:06:58,571
Crops are dead.

845
01:06:58,572 --> 01:07:00,906
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

846
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:02,309
Any bacteria that survived,

847
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,111
died in the subzero temperatures...

848
01:07:04,112 --> 01:07:06,046
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

849
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:07,715
How long does he have?

850
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,850
He can still
eat the potatoes he has,

851
01:07:10,851 --> 01:07:13,320
he just can't grow any more...

852
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,057
so give him 200 sols.

853
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:19,193
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

854
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:22,162
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

855
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,066
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.

856
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:26,899
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...

857
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,469
which changes our travel time.

858
01:07:29,737 --> 01:07:31,438
Yeah, we're working on it.

859
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:36,776
Prelim estimates call for a 414-day trip.

860
01:07:36,777 --> 01:07:39,180
It's Sol 135 now.

861
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:41,347
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

862
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,783
perform inspections...

863
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:46,086
which gives Bruce and his team...

864
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:48,590
47 days to make this probe.

865
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:53,228
I'll let you call Bruce, give him the news.

866
01:07:55,764 --> 01:07:57,499
Okay.

867
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,404
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

868
01:08:11,612 --> 01:08:14,048
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

869
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:18,653
<i>"Apparently NASA's letting
us talk to you now.</i>

870
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,490
"And I drew the short straw.

871
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:30,864
<i>"Sorry we left you behind on Mars.</i>

872
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:33,935
"But we just don't like you.

01:08:36,169 --> 01:08:41,909
"Also, it's a lot roomier on

874
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,779
<i>"We have to take turns
doing your tasks.</i>

875
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,849
"But, I mean, it's only botany.

876
01:08:50,552 --> 01:08:51,818
"It's not real science."

877
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:53,288
Oh, Jesus.

878
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,789
<i>"How's Mars?"</i>

879
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:03,865

899

Rich.

900
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:36,543
Wake up.

901
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,449
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

902
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,949
What time is it?

903
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:45,085
It's 3:42.

904
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:53,059
Look, I know we're coming
at this backwards...

905
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,761
but we can't commit to a firm launch date

906
01:12:54,762 --> 01:12:56,498
with this many unknowns.

907
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,399
It's all right. Um...

908
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,235
All 25 models for launch will
take 414 days to reach Mars.

909
01:13:02,236 --> 01:13:04,038
They vary slightly in thrust duration...

910
01:13:04,039 --> 01:13:05,807
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.

911
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:09,209
Not a good time to launch, is it?

912
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:12,145
Yeah, Earth and Mars are
really badly positioned.

913
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:14,115
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

914
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,119
Almost easier to what?

915
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,988
I need more coffee.

916
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:22,721
Ahh!

917
01:13:22,722 --> 01:13:23,757
Are you all right?

918
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:24,993
It's fine.

919
01:13:29,097 --> 01:13:31,099
Almost easier to what?

920
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:44,746
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

921
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:46,747
Uh-huh.

922
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:51,517
All right, let's ask

923
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:54,021
the very, very expensive question.

924
01:13:54,688 --> 01:13:56,489
Is the probe going to be ready on time?

925
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:58,425
<i>- We're behind.</i>
- Give me a number.

926
01:13:58,426 --> 01:14:01,928
<i>15 days. 15 days and
I can get it done.</i>

927
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:03,128
All right, let's create 15 days.

928
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:04,797
13 days to mount the probe.

929
01:14:04,798 --> 01:14:06,466
Can we reduce?

930
01:14:06,467 --> 01:14:08,601
It actually only takes three
days to mount the probe.

931
01:14:08,602 --> 01:14:10,503
And we can get that down to two, right?

932
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:12,239
<i>I can get it down to two.</i>

933
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,940
10 days are for tests and inspections.

934
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,643
How often do those
inspections reveal a problem?

935
01:14:17,846 --> 01:14:19,645
Are you suggesting we
don't do the inspections?

936
01:14:19,646 --> 01:14:21,815
Right now I'm asking how
often they reveal a problem.

937
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:23,182
One in 20.

938
01:14:23,183 --> 01:14:24,818
But that's grounds for countdown halt.

939
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:26,285
We can't take that chance.

940
01:14:26,286 --> 01:14:28,655
Anyone else know a safer
way to buy more time?

941
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:35,561
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations four more days.

942
01:14:35,562 --> 01:14:37,230
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.

943
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:38,030
And we'll cancel the inspections.

944
01:14:38,031 --> 01:14:39,498
Teddy.

945
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:41,368
- Sir, if that ever got out...
- It's on me.

946
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:42,769
You got your two weeks.

947
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,172
Get it done.

948
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:47,406
So, now I have to hold out

949
01:14:47,407 --> 01:14:49,508
until the probe gets here with more food.

950
01:14:49,509 --> 01:14:52,145
You want to see what minimal
calorie count looks like?

951
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:53,946
Standard issue ration.

952
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:58,217
But instead of three of
these every one day...

953
01:14:58,218 --> 01:15:01,822
I'm now eating one of
these every three days.

954
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:05,193
And now, they've asked me...

955
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:07,362
to do that.

956
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,368
The point is...

957
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,939
<i>"stretch the rations
four more days"...</i>

958
01:15:18,906 --> 01:15:20,841
<i>is a real dick-punch.</i>

959
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:27,649
<i>I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.</i>

960
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:31,252
And there's nobody who can stop me.

961
01:15:41,562 --> 01:15:44,832
<i>It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.</i>

962
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:59,212
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

963
01:15:59,213 --> 01:16:01,347
Let's go up here.

964
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:02,748
Labels facing up.

965
01:16:07,821 --> 01:16:09,122

Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

968
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,863
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

969
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,131
Yeah.

970
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,734
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

971
01:16:20,735 --> 01:16:23,203
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...

972
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,039
I believe in several.

973
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:29,775
We'll take all the help we can get.

<i>Performance is nominal.</i>

<i>The tail

989
01:17:15,222 --> 01:17:16,757
<i>She's rock
solid at this point, Flight.</i>

990
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:17,958
<i>TVCs look good.</i>

991
01:17:29,503 --> 01:17:31,023
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.

992
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,672
Say again?

993
01:17:33,673 --> 01:17:35,941
We are getting a very large precession.

994
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,211
Are we good?

995
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:40,079
<i>Flight,
it's hitting the redline.</i>

996
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,483
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

997
01:17:44,017 --> 01:17:45,485
Launch, what's happening?

998
01:17:45,486 --> 01:17:47,787
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

999
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,108
We've lost
readings on the probe, Flight.

1000

Oh, Jesus Christ.

1001
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:00,867

01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:54,233
Now, we finished the

We are now gonna attempt

01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:24,562
We can jettison any kind of landing system.

We're only sending rations.

1053
01:22:25,999 --> 01:22:28,068

Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

1062
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:48,453
I've got a better way.

1063
01:22:48,454 --> 01:22:49,622
Astrodynamics?

1064
01:22:49,623 --> 01:22:51,724
Yeah.

1065
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:54,627
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

1066
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:55,561
I had to make something up.

1067
01:22:55,562 --> 01:22:57,596
But "Elrond"?

1068
01:22:57,597 --> 01:22:59,666
Because it's a secret meeting.

1069
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:00,934
How do you know that?

1070
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,569
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

1071
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:05,171
<i>The Council of Elrond. It's
from</i> Lord of the Rings.

1072
01:23:05,172 --> 01:23:06,272
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1073
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:07,472
It's the meeting where they decide

1074
01:23:07,473 --> 01:23:08,807
to destroy the One Ring.

1075
01:23:08,808 --> 01:23:10,443
<i>If we're gonna call
something "Project Elrond"...</i>

1076
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,846
I would like my code
name to be "Glorfindel."

1077
01:23:12,847 --> 01:23:15,114
Okay, I hate every one of you.

1078
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,449
What, Teddy doesn't
even know about this yet?

1079
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,918
I'm sorry, who are you?

1080
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:20,679
This is Rich
Purnell, Astrodynamics.

1081
01:23:21,722 --> 01:23:23,355
Tell them what you just told me.

1082
01:23:23,356 --> 01:23:26,527
I can get the <i>Hermes</i>
back to Mars by Sol 561.

1083
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,330
How?

1084
01:23:33,334 --> 01:23:36,203
Could you stand right there for me, please?

1085
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,704
Thanks.

1086
01:23:38,705 --> 01:23:40,207
Right there. Great.

1087
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:44,411
And could you stand
right there? Right there.

1088
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:52,718
Okay, let's pretend that this
stapler is the <i>Hermes...</i>

1089
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,221
and you are...

1090
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:56,756
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

1091
01:23:56,757 --> 01:24:00,526
Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

1092
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:02,995
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

1093
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,330
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

1094
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:07,801
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

1095
01:24:07,802 --> 01:24:10,270
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

1096
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:16,708
we start accelerating immediately

1097
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:18,645
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

1098
01:24:18,646 --> 01:24:19,712
We don't intercept with Earth at all...

1099
01:24:19,713 --> 01:24:21,212
but we come close enough

1100
01:24:21,213 --> 01:24:23,516
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1101
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,519
While we're doing that...

1102
01:24:27,553 --> 01:24:29,422
we resupply with the probe...

1103
01:24:29,423 --> 01:24:30,690
The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

1104
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:32,324
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

1105
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:34,427
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

1106
01:24:36,829 --> 01:24:38,530
You're Mars.

1107
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,798
Now, we're going too fast

1108
01:24:39,799 --> 01:24:41,566
at this point to fall into orbit...

1109
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,002
but we can do a flyby.

1110
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:44,203
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1111
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,204
<i>if we can't get Watney
off the surface?</i>

1112
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,074
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

1113
01:24:49,075 --> 01:24:50,411
Ow!

1114
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,714
And then we just head home.

1115
01:25:00,187 --> 01:25:02,690
I've done the math. It checks out.

1116
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:05,691
<i>- Rich.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1117
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:06,758
Get out.

1118
01:25:06,759 --> 01:25:08,229
All right.

1119
01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:16,369
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

1120
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:18,971
Bruce, what do you think?

1121
01:25:18,972 --> 01:25:20,640
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1122
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,077
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1123
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,477
Uh-huh.

1124
01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:27,613
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1125
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:29,147
Because we can only do one.

1126
01:25:29,148 --> 01:25:31,383
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1127
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,052
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1128
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,087
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1129
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,390
so we have to choose.

1130
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:39,025
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1131
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:40,892
We'd be asking them to add

1132
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:44,396
533 extra days to their mission.

1133
01:25:44,397 --> 01:25:46,237
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1134
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,034
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1135
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:50,236
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1136
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:51,404
It should.

1137
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:53,573
Built to last the full
<i>Ares</i> mission...

1138
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:56,175
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1139
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:57,577
But if something goes wrong...

1140
01:25:57,578 --> 01:25:59,412
Then we lose the crew.

1141
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:00,913
<i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

1142
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:03,082
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1143
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:05,685
<i>or a low chance of
killing six people.</i>

1144
01:26:05,686 --> 01:26:07,086
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1145
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:08,788
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1146
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,522
He does.

1147
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:12,025
Yeah, well, bullshit.

1148
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:14,026
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1149
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:15,861
We still have a chance to bring

1150
01:26:15,862 --> 01:26:17,396
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1151
01:26:17,397 --> 01:26:19,300
I'm not risking their lives.

1152
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,935
Let them make that decision.

1153
01:26:22,669 --> 01:26:25,438
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1154
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:29,376
You goddamn coward.

1155
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:50,296
<i>- Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

1156
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:52,731
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1157
01:26:52,732 --> 01:26:53,766
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1158
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:54,633
<i>Where are you?</i>

1159
01:26:54,634 --> 01:26:55,935
The gym.

1160
01:27:17,557 --> 01:27:19,092
What's up?

1161
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:20,293
I just got an email from my wife

1162
01:27:20,294 --> 01:27:23,462
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1163
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:25,632
My computer won't open the attachment.

1164
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,066
Okay.

1165
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,569
Let's take a look.

1166
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,608
Uh...

1167
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:36,977
Let's see.

1168
01:27:39,044 --> 01:27:41,547
This isn't a JPEG.

1169
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,118
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1170
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,700
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1171
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,458
Does that make any sense to you?

1172
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:56,096
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1173
01:27:56,097 --> 01:27:58,865
It's a course maneuver
for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1174
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:06,772
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1175
01:28:06,773 --> 01:28:08,007
211 days later.

1176
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:11,310
Would it work?

1177
01:28:11,311 --> 01:28:13,245
Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1178
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,881
It's a brilliant course.

1179
01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:18,017
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1180
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:19,819
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1181
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,988
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1182
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:24,190
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1183
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:27,528
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1184
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:30,930
So, are we gonna do it?

1185
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:34,266
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1186
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,903
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1187
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:38,270
Not this time.

1188
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,208
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1189
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:43,976
We're talking about mutiny here,

1190
01:28:43,977 --> 01:28:45,444
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1191
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,314
So we do this together or not at all.

1192
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:51,449
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1193
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:54,553
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1194
01:28:54,554 --> 01:28:57,455
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1195
01:28:57,456 --> 01:29:00,659
If we do everything perfectly...

1196
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,129
we add 533 days to our mission.

1197
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:08,101
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1198
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:12,738
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1199
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:14,373
where anything could go wrong.

1200
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:17,945
If it's mission critical, we die.

1201
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:19,912
Sign me up.

1202
01:29:19,913 --> 01:29:21,346
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1203
01:29:21,347 --> 01:29:23,483
You and I, we're military.

1204
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:24,984
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1205
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,185
Yeah, there's that.

1206
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:27,619
And for the rest of you guys...

1207
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,522
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1208
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:35,093
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1209
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:36,729
I plot the course and execute it.

1210
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,230
Remote override.

1211
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,297
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1212
01:29:39,298 --> 01:29:40,833
from Mission Control.

1213
01:29:41,869 --> 01:29:44,203
Can you disable it?

1214
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:46,372
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1215
01:29:46,373 --> 01:29:48,807
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1216
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:50,142
We can't shut down the comms

1217
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,677
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1218
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,412
And we can't shut down the computers

1219
01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:55,347
because we need to run the ship.

1220
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,818
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1221
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,852
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1222
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:03,623
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1223
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,859
I can do it.

1224
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:08,896
Great.

1225
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,032
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1226
01:30:12,766 --> 01:30:17,604
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1227
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:23,775
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1228
01:30:23,776 --> 01:30:25,645
so, yes.

1229
01:30:25,646 --> 01:30:27,180
I vote yes.

1230
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:31,051
Let's go get him.

1231
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:35,421
Johanssen?

1232
01:30:35,422 --> 01:30:36,888
Yes.

1233
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:38,056
Yeah!

1234
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:43,395
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

1235
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:44,629
Roger. Read it out.

1236
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,499
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

1237
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,068
"Rich Purnell is a
steely-eyed missile man."

1238
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,468
What?

1239
01:30:50,469 --> 01:30:51,970
Flight, Guidance.

1240
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:54,105
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

1241
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:55,341
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i>
they're drifting.

1242
01:30:55,342 --> 01:30:57,208
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1243
01:30:57,209 --> 01:30:58,209
Negative, Flight,

1244
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,811
it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

1245
01:30:59,812 --> 01:31:01,446
What the hell?

1246
01:31:01,447 --> 01:31:04,650
Telemetry, any chance this
is instrumentation failure?

1247
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:06,385
Negative, Flight.

1248
01:31:06,386 --> 01:31:07,520
Guidance, work at how long they can stay

1249
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:09,387
on this course before it's irreversible.

1250
01:31:09,388 --> 01:31:11,056
Working on that now, Flight.

1251
01:31:11,057 --> 01:31:12,958
Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

1252
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:14,927
I dunno.

1253
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,663
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1254
01:31:17,664 --> 01:31:19,565
Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1255
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:21,301
and inform them of NASA's decision

1256
01:31:21,302 --> 01:31:24,235
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1257
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,072
Sounds like a smart move.

1258
01:31:26,972 --> 01:31:29,941
Considering the circumstances.

1259
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:34,546
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1260
01:31:34,547 --> 01:31:36,382
Crew made the decision on their own.

1261
01:31:38,151 --> 01:31:40,087
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1262
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,123
We're fighting the same war.

1263
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,458
Every time something goes wrong,

1264
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,325
the world forgets why we fly.

1265
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,095
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1266
01:31:49,096 --> 01:31:51,097
It's bigger than one person.

1267
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,601
No.

1268
01:31:54,602 --> 01:31:55,836
It's not.

1269
01:31:57,036 --> 01:32:00,740
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1270
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:05,378
I understand.

1271
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:07,981
Bring our astronauts home.

1272
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,953
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1273
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:16,622
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1274
01:32:16,623 --> 01:32:18,056
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1275
01:32:18,057 --> 01:32:19,492
rather than bring it with us.

1276
01:32:19,493 --> 01:32:23,096
So, as a result, the
MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1277
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:24,463
is already there

1278
01:32:24,464 --> 01:32:26,632
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1279
01:32:26,633 --> 01:32:30,369
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1280
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:33,405
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1281
01:32:33,406 --> 01:32:36,876
and I guess they catch me?

1282
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,445
In space.

1283
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:45,051
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

1284
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:47,886
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1285
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:49,555
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,

1286
01:32:49,556 --> 01:32:51,556
the atmospheric regulator...

1287
01:32:51,557 --> 01:32:53,793
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

1288
01:32:53,794 --> 01:32:56,160
<i>And luckily, I have
the greatest minds</i>

1289
01:32:56,161 --> 01:32:57,729

1292
01:33:02,669 --> 01:33:04,503
<i>And so far they've come up with...</i>

01:33:04,504 --> 01:33:05,637
<i>"Hey, why don't you drill holes</i>

1296

<i>maritime law applies.</i>

01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:29,628
<i>So Mars is international waters.</i>

1364
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:33,031
<i>Now, NASA is an American

1390
01:41:25,637 --> 01:41:27,038
lays the solar panels,

01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,173
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...

1392
01:41:29,174 --> 01:41:33,479

How's he doing?

1394
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:41,720
He asked us to call

1395
01:41:43,623 --> 01:41:45,724
Well, technically, Mars
would be under maritime...

1396

01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:48,681
Yeah, the problem is
the intercept velocity.

01:43:48,682 --> 01:43:53,584
The <i>Hermes,</i> well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1406
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:56,954
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

1407
01:43:56,955 --> 01:43:58,989
The MAV, that was only designed

1408
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:01,659
to get to low Mars orbit.

1409
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:05,763
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...

1410
01:44:05,764 --> 01:44:07,332
and to intercept the <i>Hermes...</i>

1411
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:09,333
- He has to be going fast.
- Exactly.

1412
01:44:09,334 --> 01:44:11,537
<i>Which means we need to
make the MAV lighter.</i>

1413
01:44:11,538 --> 01:44:14,205
<i>A lot lighter. 5,000
kilograms lighter.</i>

1414
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:15,640
You can do that, right?

1415
01:44:15,641 --> 01:44:17,574
<i>There's some gimmes
right off the bat.</i>

1416
01:44:17,575 --> 01:44:19,177
<i>The design presumes 500 kilograms</i>

1417
01:44:19,178 --> 01:44:20,846
<i>of Martian soil and samples.</i>

1418
01:44:20,847 --> 01:44:22,646
Obviously we won't do that.

1419
01:44:22,647 --> 01:44:26,485
And there's just one
passenger instead of six.

1420
01:44:26,486 --> 01:44:29,221
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

1421
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:31,489
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

1422
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:33,324
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

1423
01:44:33,325 --> 01:44:35,060
Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit,

1424
01:44:35,061 --> 01:44:36,395
how is he gonna operate the controls?

1425
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:38,829
Well, he won't.

1426
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:42,699
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the <i>Hermes.</i>

1427
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:45,404
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1428
01:44:46,771 --> 01:44:49,141
But I am excited about

1429
01:44:49,142 --> 01:44:51,476
the opportunities that affords.

1430
01:44:51,477 --> 01:44:53,944
If we go remote, we can
lose the control panels,

1431
01:44:53,945 --> 01:44:55,747
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

1432
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,047
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1433
01:44:57,048 --> 01:45:00,919
<i>You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?</i>

1434
01:45:03,155 --> 01:45:05,791
He's not even got to the
bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1435
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,458
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

1436
01:45:07,459 --> 01:45:09,293
We need to remove the nose airlock,

1437
01:45:09,294 --> 01:45:12,197
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

1438
01:45:13,932 --> 01:45:15,065
You want to take the front of the ship off?

1439
01:45:15,066 --> 01:45:16,633
<i>Sure.</i>

1440
01:45:16,634 --> 01:45:19,537
<i>The nose airlock alone
is 400 kilograms.</i>

1441
01:45:19,538 --> 01:45:20,904
You want to send a man into space

1442
01:45:20,905 --> 01:45:21,906
without the front of his ship?

1443
01:45:21,907 --> 01:45:23,443
<i>Well, no.</i>

1444
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:27,580
<i>We're gonna have him
cover it with Hab canvas.</i>

1445
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:31,983
<i>Look, the hull's mostly
there to keep the air in.</i>

1446
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:33,551
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

1447
01:45:33,552 --> 01:45:35,352
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1448
01:45:35,353 --> 01:45:36,887
By the time the ship's going fast enough

1449
01:45:36,888 --> 01:45:38,690
for air resistance to matter...

1450
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:41,325
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

1451
01:45:41,326 --> 01:45:43,761
You wanna send him into space under a tarp.

1452
01:45:43,762 --> 01:45:45,997
<i>Yes.</i>

1453
01:45:45,998 --> 01:45:47,798
<i>Can I go on?</i>

1454
01:45:47,799 --> 01:45:49,167
No.

1455
01:45:55,374 --> 01:45:58,008
You think he means it like...

1456
01:45:58,009 --> 01:46:00,011
"Are you kidding me?"

1457
01:46:00,012 --> 01:46:01,445
- You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

1458
01:46:01,446 --> 01:46:04,783
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1459
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,151
I think it might be the second one.

1460
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:08,852
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1461
01:46:08,853 --> 01:46:11,122
Could be the first way.

1462
01:46:11,123 --> 01:46:12,592
"Are you kidding me?"

1463
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:15,161
Yeah, it could be the first way.

1464
01:46:39,352 --> 01:46:42,419
<i>I know what they're doing.</i>

1465
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:45,123
I know exactly what they're doing.

1466
01:46:45,124 --> 01:46:47,359
They just keep repeating...

1467
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,328
"Go faster than any man in
the history of space travel."

1468
01:46:50,329 --> 01:46:51,762
<i>Like that's a good thing.</i>

1469
01:46:51,763 --> 01:46:54,000
<i>Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.</i>

1470
01:46:55,401 --> 01:46:57,034
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man

1471
01:46:57,035 --> 01:46:59,236
in the history of space travel...

1472
01:46:59,237 --> 01:47:02,073
because you are launching
me in a convertible.

1473
01:47:02,074 --> 01:47:03,874
Actually it's worse than that

1474
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,910
because I won't even be
able to control the thing.

1475
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:08,712
<i>And by the way, physicists,</i>

1476
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:11,483
<i>when describing things
like acceleration...</i>

1477
01:47:11,484 --> 01:47:13,786
<i>do not use the word "fast."</i>

1478
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:16,687
So they're only doing that in the hopes

1479
01:47:16,688 --> 01:47:18,990
that I won't raise any objections...

1480
01:47:19,758 --> 01:47:22,060
to this lunacy.

1481
01:47:22,794 --> 01:47:24,596
<i>Because I like the way</i>

1482
01:47:24,597 --> 01:47:27,567
<i>"fastest man in the history
of space travel" sounds.</i>

1483
01:47:29,134 --> 01:47:31,237
<i>I do like the way it sounds.</i>

1484
01:47:32,204 --> 01:47:34,239
<i>I mean, I like it a lot.</i>

1485
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:38,911
<i>I'm not gonna tell them that.</i>

1486
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:46,018
<i>Okay.</i>

1487
01:47:47,286 --> 01:47:49,421

1523
01:50:22,674 --> 01:50:23,941
<i>with the outer door open...</i>

1524
01:50:23,942 --> 01:50:25,909
<i>- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.</i>

1525
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:29,614
<i>Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.</i>

1526
01:50:29,615 --> 01:50:31,548
<i>Once we hit intercept,</i>

1527
01:50:31,549 --> 01:50:33,484
<i>it's Beck's job to go get Watney.</i>

1528
01:50:33,485 --> 01:50:34,685
We're ready.

1529
01:50:34,686 --> 01:50:36,122
What's the intercept plan?

1530
01:50:36,989 --> 01:50:39,323
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

1531
01:50:39,324 --> 01:50:41,426
It's 214 meters long.

1532
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:42,694
And I'll have the MMU,

1533
01:50:42,695 --> 01:50:44,462
so moving around should be easy.

1534
01:50:44,463 --> 01:50:46,297
How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

1535
01:50:47,365 --> 01:50:49,934
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

1536
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:52,369
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.

1537
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:54,337
So any more than that and I might miss.

1538
01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:56,274
Well, we may have some leeway.

1539
01:50:57,676 --> 01:50:59,744
The launch takes 12 minutes.

1540
01:50:59,745 --> 01:51:03,248
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1541
01:51:03,249 --> 01:51:05,717
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1542
01:51:05,718 --> 01:51:08,218
we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

1543
01:51:08,219 --> 01:51:10,055
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1544
01:51:10,056 --> 01:51:12,757
Everything goes well, you pull
them on board with the tether.

1545
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:15,427
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1546
01:51:15,428 --> 01:51:16,761
Yep.

1547
01:51:16,762 --> 01:51:17,996
Okay.

1548
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:22,434
Let's go get our boy.

1549
01:52:23,728 --> 01:52:25,628
There's a mood
of tension and anxiety here,

1550
01:52:25,629 --> 01:52:27,131
outside Johnson Space Center.

1551
01:52:27,132 --> 01:52:28,400
As you can see,

1552
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:29,699
many people have gathered here...

1553
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,068
to see whether or not

1554
01:52:31,069 --> 01:52:35,306
the mission to retrieve Mark
Watney will be a success.

1555
01:52:35,307 --> 01:52:37,141
<i>They've had some contact with him,</i>

1556
01:52:37,142 --> 01:52:39,177
<i>but it hasn't been very much.</i>

1557
01:52:39,178 --> 01:52:40,544
<i>We have to remind our viewers</i>

1558
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:42,445
<i>that we're watching
this as it unfolds.</i>

1559
01:52:42,446 --> 01:52:44,382
<i>So we'll try and
keep you up-to-date</i>

1560
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:46,351
<i>as to what exactly is going on.</i>

1561
01:52:46,352 --> 01:52:50,053
<i>Let's listen in to NASA making
contact with Mark Watney.</i>

1562
01:52:50,054 --> 01:52:51,422
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

1563
01:52:58,129 --> 01:53:00,564
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

1564
01:53:00,565 --> 01:53:03,568
Not a damn thing.

1565
01:53:03,569 --> 01:53:05,537
It's all happening 12
light-minutes away...

1566
01:53:05,538 --> 01:53:07,137
which means it takes 24 minutes for them

1567
01:53:07,138 --> 01:53:09,207
to get the answer to any question they ask.

1568
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:12,344
The whole launch is 12 minutes...

1569
01:53:13,812 --> 01:53:15,614
so they're on their own.

1570
01:54:20,945 --> 01:54:21,812
<i>...just how
long Mark has been</i>

1571
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:23,213
<i>completely alone on Mars.</i>

1572
01:54:23,214 --> 01:54:26,184
<i>We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...</i>

1573
01:54:48,874 --> 01:54:50,641
<i>Fuel pressure, green.</i>

1574
01:54:50,642 --> 01:54:52,976
Engine alignment, perfect.

1575
01:54:52,977 --> 01:54:54,445
<i>Communications, five by five.</i>

1576
01:54:56,213 --> 01:54:59,150
<i>We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.</i>

1577
01:54:59,151 --> 01:55:01,686
<i>Mission Control, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1578
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:03,989
<i>We will proceed on schedule.</i>

1579
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:05,823
<i>We are T-minus 2
minutes, 10 seconds</i>

1580
01:55:05,824 --> 01:55:07,493
<i>to launch, by the mark.</i>

1581
01:55:08,593 --> 01:55:09,761
About two minutes, Watney.

1582
01:55:09,762 --> 01:55:10,995
<i>How you doing down there?</i>

1583
01:55:10,996 --> 01:55:12,962
I'm good.

1584
01:55:12,963 --> 01:55:15,431
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1585
01:55:15,432 --> 01:55:16,801
Thanks for coming back for me.

1586
01:55:16,802 --> 01:55:18,136
<i>Well, we're on it.</i>

1587
01:55:18,137 --> 01:55:19,770
<i>Remember, you'll be
pulling some serious G's,</i>

1588
01:55:19,771 --> 01:55:21,672
<i>so it's okay to pass out.</i>

1589
01:55:21,673 --> 01:55:23,674
You're in Martinez's hands now.

1590
01:55:24,442 --> 01:55:26,244
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

1591
01:55:27,612 --> 01:55:29,379
Copy that, MAV.

1592
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,547
<i>CAPCOM.</i>

1593
01:55:30,548 --> 01:55:31,749
<i>Go.</i>

1594
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:32,682
<i>Remote command.</i>

1595
01:55:32,683 --> 01:55:33,717
<i>Go.</i>

1596
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:34,785

1597

1598
01:55:35,986 --> 01:55:37,454

01:55:37,455 --> 01:55:38,455
<i>Go.</i>

1600
01:55:38,456 --> 01:55:39,757
Pilot.

1601
01:55:40,926 --> 01:55:42,126
Go.

1602
01:55:42,127 --> 01:55:43,561
<i>Pilot.</i>

1603
01:55:43,562 --> 01:55:44,994
<i>Go.</i>

1604
01:55:44,995 --> 01:55:46,675
<i>Copy. We're go.</i>

1605
01:55:47,098 --> 01:55:49,501
<i>Mission Control,
we are go for launch.</i>

1606
01:55:50,136 --> 01:55:51,334
T-minus ten...

1607
01:55:51,335 --> 01:55:52,503
nine...

1608
01:55:52,504 --> 01:55:53,671
Main engine start.

1609
01:55:53,672 --> 01:55:55,138
<i>Eight...</i>

1610
01:55:55,139 --> 01:55:56,406
<i>seven...</i>

1611
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:58,208
<i>Mooring clamps released.</i>

1612
01:55:58,209 --> 01:55:59,944
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1613
01:55:59,945 --> 01:56:01,812
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1614
01:56:01,813 --> 01:56:03,446
<i>Four...</i>

1615
01:56:03,447 --> 01:56:05,114
<i>three...</i>

1616
01:56:05,115 --> 01:56:06,583
<i>two...</i>

1617
01:56:06,584 --> 01:56:08,087
<i>one.</i>

1618
01:56:44,155 --> 01:56:46,591
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1619
01:56:46,592 --> 01:56:48,659
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1620
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:49,961
That's too low.

1621
01:56:49,962 --> 01:56:51,430
It's fighting me.

1622
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,369
<i>Watney, do you read?</i>

1623
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:05,842
<i>Booster
separation complete.</i>

1624
01:57:05,843 --> 01:57:08,980
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1625
01:57:08,981 --> 01:57:10,315
He's well below target altitude.

1626
01:57:10,316 --> 01:57:11,983
How far below?

1627
01:57:11,984 --> 01:57:13,583
Checking.

1628
01:57:13,584 --> 01:57:15,520
Watney.

1629
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:17,020
Do you read?

1630
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:18,321
<i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1631
01:57:18,322 --> 01:57:19,556
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1632
01:57:19,557 --> 01:57:20,891
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1633
01:57:20,892 --> 01:57:22,361
<i>Copy that.</i>

1634
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:26,430
<i>Main shutdown in three...</i>

1635
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:28,666
<i>two, one...</i>

1636
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:29,935
<i>shutdown.</i>

1637
01:57:31,469 --> 01:57:33,171
<i>Back to automatic guidance.</i>

1638
01:57:33,804 --> 01:57:35,407
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

1639
01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:39,610
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

1640
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:42,913
<i>Watney?</i>

1641
01:57:42,914 --> 01:57:44,515
<i>Do you read?</i>

1642
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:46,583
<i>It seems there's
some sort of problem</i>

1643
01:57:46,584 --> 01:57:48,319
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1644
01:57:55,192 --> 01:57:57,128
<i>I have interval pings.</i>

1645
01:57:57,129 --> 01:57:58,962
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1646
01:57:58,963 --> 01:58:00,932
I can make that work.

1647
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:04,168
Distance at intercept will be...

1648
01:58:04,169 --> 01:58:06,404
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1649
01:58:06,405 --> 01:58:08,506
<i>68 kilometers?</i>

1650
01:58:08,507 --> 01:58:10,943
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1651
01:58:11,776 --> 01:58:12,642
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1652
01:58:12,643 --> 01:58:13,845
Work the problem.

1653
01:58:14,478 --> 01:58:16,846
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1654
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:18,817
<i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1655
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:20,851
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1656
01:58:20,852 --> 01:58:22,653
in the same direction?

1657
01:58:22,654 --> 01:58:25,923
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1658
01:58:25,924 --> 01:58:27,056
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1659
01:58:27,057 --> 01:58:28,458
How much do you need?

1660
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:32,830
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1661
01:58:33,999 --> 01:58:37,267
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1662
01:58:37,268 --> 01:58:39,136
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1663
01:58:39,137 --> 01:58:40,404
Do it.

1664
01:58:41,139 --> 01:58:44,542
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1665
01:58:44,543 --> 01:58:47,144
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1666
01:58:47,145 --> 01:58:49,413
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1667
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:51,414
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1668
01:58:51,415 --> 01:58:53,018
how to slow down.

1669
01:58:55,954 --> 01:58:57,855
Martinez, burn the jets.

1670
01:58:57,856 --> 01:58:59,524
Copy that.

1671
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:23,780
MAV to <i>Hermes.</i>

1672
01:59:23,781 --> 01:59:24,948
<i>Watney?</i>

1673
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:25,949
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1674
01:59:30,054 --> 01:59:31,821
<i>What's your status?</i>

1675
01:59:31,822 --> 01:59:33,791
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

1676
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:35,959
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1677
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,394
<i>How are you?</i>

1678
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:38,495
<i>We're working
on getting to you.</i>

1679
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,998
<i>There was a complication
during launch.</i>

1680
01:59:39,999 --> 01:59:41,932
Copy that.

1681
01:59:41,933 --> 01:59:43,967
How bad is it?

1682
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,470
<i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1683
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:47,605
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1684
01:59:47,606 --> 01:59:48,873
<i>How big a problem?</i>

1685
01:59:48,874 --> 01:59:50,641
42 meters a second.

1686
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:51,943
Well...

1687
01:59:52,878 --> 01:59:54,746
shit.

1688
01:59:59,618 --> 02:00:01,519
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1689
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,253
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1690
02:00:03,254 --> 02:00:06,489
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1691
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,494
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1692
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:11,962
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1693
02:00:11,963 --> 02:00:13,696
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1694
02:00:13,697 --> 02:00:17,167
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1695
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:19,003
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1696
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,937
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1697
02:00:20,938 --> 02:00:23,373
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1698
02:00:23,374 --> 02:00:27,110
Yes, those are all very good points.

1699
02:00:27,111 --> 02:00:30,081
But consider this.

1700
02:00:32,150 --> 02:00:34,784
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

1701
02:00:35,954 --> 02:00:37,753
<i>Commander...</i>

1702
02:00:37,754 --> 02:00:39,623
<i>let's go Iron Man.</i>

1703
02:00:42,526 --> 02:00:44,227
<i>This
is unexpected LOS.</i>

1704
02:00:44,228 --> 02:00:46,108
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1705
02:00:46,964 --> 02:00:49,833
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1706
02:00:49,834 --> 02:00:51,702
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1707
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:53,003
Not what he said.

1708
02:00:53,004 --> 02:00:55,407
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1709
02:00:57,409 --> 02:00:59,610
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1710
02:00:59,611 --> 02:01:01,645
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1711
02:01:01,646 --> 02:01:02,980
It'll give us a good kick.

1712
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:05,048
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1713
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,952
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1714
02:01:07,953 --> 02:01:10,187
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1715
02:01:10,188 --> 02:01:11,821
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1716
02:01:11,822 --> 02:01:13,123
Vogel.

1717
02:01:13,124 --> 02:01:15,025
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

1718
02:01:15,026 --> 02:01:18,061
I need you to come
inside and make a... bomb.

1719
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:19,163
Again, Commander?

1720
02:01:19,164 --> 02:01:20,464
<i>You're a chemist.</i>

1721
02:01:20,465 --> 02:01:22,434
<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

1722
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,404
Probably.

1723
02:01:26,169 --> 02:01:27,604
But I feel obliged to mention

1724
02:01:27,605 --> 02:01:29,640
that setting off an explosive device...

1725
02:01:29,641 --> 02:01:32,610
<i>in a spacecraft is a
terrible, terrible idea.</i>

1726
02:01:32,611 --> 02:01:35,712
Hang on. You guys making a bomb without me?

1727
02:01:35,713 --> 02:01:37,848
<i>Copy that. Can you do it?</i>

1728
02:01:39,884 --> 02:01:41,185
<i>Ja.</i>

1729
02:01:44,056 --> 02:01:45,989
<i>Houston, be advised.</i>

1730
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:47,257
<i>We are going to
deliberately breach the VAL</i>

1731
02:01:47,258 --> 02:01:48,994
<i>to produce a reverse thrust.</i>

1732
02:01:50,294 --> 02:01:52,696
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1733
02:01:52,697 --> 02:01:54,097
We'll open the outer door.

1734
02:01:54,098 --> 02:01:56,167
<i>I need you to place the
charge on the inner door.</i>

1735
02:01:56,168 --> 02:01:58,200
<i>Climb back to Airlock
2 along the hull.</i>

1736
02:01:58,201 --> 02:02:00,204
Copy. I'm on my way.

1737
02:02:07,212 --> 02:02:08,979
I'm in, Commander.

1738
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:10,148
<i>Copy that.</i>

1739
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:21,024
Vogel, where are you?

1740
02:02:21,025 --> 02:02:21,958
<i>I'm in the kitchen.</i>

1741
02:02:21,959 --> 02:02:23,461
Okay.

1742
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:28,399
<i>Commander...</i>

1743
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,333
I can't let you go through with this.

1744
02:02:30,334 --> 02:02:32,102
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1745
02:02:32,103 --> 02:02:33,636
Absolutely not.

1746
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:36,339
<i>See, the
thing is, I'm selfish.</i>

1747
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:38,909
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

1748
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:40,276
<i>Just me.</i>

1749
02:02:40,277 --> 02:02:42,678
I should have left this guy on Mars.

1750
02:02:42,679 --> 02:02:43,981
Hey.

1751
02:02:46,584 --> 02:02:47,651
Sugar?

1752
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:48,953
Yeah.

1753
02:02:52,856 --> 02:02:54,891
Can you hold this?

1754
02:02:54,892 --> 02:02:57,028
Liquid oxygen...

1755
02:02:57,029 --> 02:03:00,565
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1756
02:03:03,968 --> 02:03:07,238
This thing here is five times stronger

1757
02:03:07,239 --> 02:03:08,705
than a stick of dynamite.

1758
02:03:08,706 --> 02:03:10,307
How do we activate it?

1759
02:03:10,308 --> 02:03:13,010
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?

1760
02:03:16,213 --> 02:03:17,882
Careful.

1761
02:03:24,187 --> 02:03:25,923
Open Airlock 1.

1762
02:03:31,629 --> 02:03:32,989
I'm on the way to Beck.

1763
02:03:37,235 --> 02:03:38,836
Let's just hope this is a good idea, guys.

1764
02:03:38,837 --> 02:03:40,102
It is.

1765
02:03:40,103 --> 02:03:41,605
<i>Open A1.</i>

1766
02:03:46,645 --> 02:03:47,878
- Hi.
- Hey.

1767
02:03:51,249 --> 02:03:53,051
- You got it?
- Mmm.

1768
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:01,259
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1769
02:04:02,794 --> 02:04:04,227
Hey.

1770
02:04:04,228 --> 02:04:06,129
Be careful out there.

1771
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:07,731
In space.

1772
02:04:11,535 --> 02:04:14,104
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1773
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,050
Bomb set.

1774
02:04:33,657 --> 02:04:36,161
Leaving Airlock 1.

1775
02:04:41,098 --> 02:04:42,266
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

1776
02:04:42,267 --> 02:04:43,601
and even with optimal VAL blow...

1777
02:04:43,602 --> 02:04:45,534
we're gonna be off on our angle.

1778
02:04:45,535 --> 02:04:48,305
What's the intercept distance? Johanssen?

1779
02:04:48,306 --> 02:04:50,775
260 meters, approximate.

1780
02:04:50,776 --> 02:04:52,243
That's too far.

1781
02:05:01,052 --> 02:05:02,519
Commander?

1782
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,722
Martinez, close the door.

1783
02:05:07,825 --> 02:05:09,827
Open D3.

1784
02:05:09,828 --> 02:05:11,863
And leave it open.

1785
02:05:40,191 --> 02:05:42,160
<i>Open B2.</i>

1786
02:05:46,097 --> 02:05:47,631

<i>time to VAL blow after initiate?</i>

1788
02:05:50,035 --> 02:05:51,601
15 seconds.

1789
02:05:51,602 --> 02:05:54,305
We sure know how to cut it close.

1790
02:05:54,306 --> 02:05:55,571
Commander?

1791
02:05:55,572 --> 02:05:58,042
Distance is too far. I'm going out.

1792
02:05:58,043 --> 02:05:59,176
I can do this.

1793
02:05:59,177 --> 02:06:00,543
It's not a debate.

1794
02:06:00,544 --> 02:06:02,279
I'm not risking another crew member.

1795
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,114
Beck's returned.

1796
02:06:04,115 --> 02:06:06,083
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1797
02:06:06,084 --> 02:06:07,316
Ten seconds.

1798
02:06:07,317 --> 02:06:09,352
Strap in.

1799
02:06:09,353 --> 02:06:11,855
<i>Five, four...</i>

1800
02:06:11,856 --> 02:06:13,289
three...

1801
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:15,158
- Brace for deceleration.
<i>Two...</i>

1802
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:16,392
one.

1803
02:06:16,393 --> 02:06:17,996
Activating Panel 41.

1804
02:06:39,883 --> 02:06:41,150
Bridge seal holding.

1805
02:06:41,151 --> 02:06:42,485
What's the damage?

1806
02:06:42,486 --> 02:06:43,686
<i>Worry about that later.</i>

1807
02:06:43,687 --> 02:06:45,387
<i>What's the relative velocity?</i>

1808
02:06:45,388 --> 02:06:46,922
12 meters per second.

1809
02:06:46,923 --> 02:06:49,124
<i>Copy.</i>

1810
02:06:50,361 --> 02:06:51,795
Hook me up.

1811
02:06:53,164 --> 02:06:54,766
Done.

1812
02:07:04,409 --> 02:07:06,311
I have visual on the MAV.

1813
02:07:07,511 --> 02:07:09,445
<i>What's the intercept range?</i>

1814
02:07:09,446 --> 02:07:11,481
I'm checking.

1815
02:07:11,482 --> 02:07:13,184
312 meters.

1816
02:07:13,185 --> 02:07:15,851
Did you say 312?

1817
02:07:15,852 --> 02:07:18,422
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

1818
02:07:21,793 --> 02:07:22,994
Oh!

1819
02:07:27,597 --> 02:07:29,565
I can't get to you, Mark. You're too far.

1820
02:07:29,566 --> 02:07:30,700
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1821
02:07:30,701 --> 02:07:31,935
I know.

1822
02:07:31,936 --> 02:07:33,870
<i>Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.</i>

1823
02:07:33,871 --> 02:07:36,440
Commander, I got this.

1824
02:07:50,155 --> 02:07:52,087
Mark, report.

1825
02:07:52,088 --> 02:07:53,890
On my way, Commander.

1826
02:07:53,891 --> 02:07:55,691
Damn it.

1827
02:08:05,035 --> 02:08:07,370
Johanssen, what's my
relative velocity to Mark?

1828
02:08:07,371 --> 02:08:09,405
5.2 meters per second.

1829
02:08:09,406 --> 02:08:11,208
Copy. Adjusting course.

1830
02:08:16,847 --> 02:08:18,817
<i>3.1 meters per second.</i>

1831
02:08:21,252 --> 02:08:23,421
<i>Distance to target, 24 meters.</i>

1832
02:08:25,155 --> 02:08:27,192
11 meters to target.

1833
02:08:29,893 --> 02:08:31,095
<i>Six meters.</i>

1834
02:08:41,106 --> 02:08:43,541
Hold on, Mark.

1835
02:09:11,303 --> 02:09:12,401
I got him.

1836
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,406
<i>I got him.</i>

1837
02:09:17,407 --> 02:09:19,008
<i>I got him.</i>

1838
02:09:19,009 --> 02:09:20,612
Way to go, Iron Man.

1839
02:09:23,548 --> 02:09:25,115
Beck, pull us in.

1840
02:09:28,219 --> 02:09:29,887
It's good to see you.

1841
02:09:31,289 --> 02:09:32,624
You...

1842
02:09:34,357 --> 02:09:38,428
have terrible taste in music.

1843
02:09:47,638 --> 02:09:49,405
<i>Houston, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1844
02:09:49,406 --> 02:09:50,541
<i>We got him.</i>

1845
02:09:52,509 --> 02:09:54,144
<i>Watney is secure.</i>

1846
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:01,584
Contact in
outer space with Mark Watney.

1847
02:10:01,585 --> 02:10:03,686
<i>After a very long
time, they have done</i>

1848
02:10:03,687 --> 02:10:05,855
<i>what many people
thought was impossible.</i>

1849
02:10:05,856 --> 02:10:07,156
<i>Mission confirmation:</i>

1850
02:10:07,157 --> 02:10:09,859
<i>Mark Watney has been
successfully rescued.</i>

1851
02:10:13,463 --> 02:10:15,265
Grab a hold of him.

1852
02:10:17,034 --> 02:10:18,435
Hey, handsome!

1853
02:10:18,436 --> 02:10:20,271
Beck, close the hatch.

1854
02:10:23,206 --> 02:10:24,708
Hey, guys!

1855
02:10:29,414 --> 02:10:31,582
<i>Houston, six
crew safely aboard.</i>

1856
02:10:36,087 --> 02:10:39,288
<i>This is huge moment for this
nation, for the world...</i>

1857
02:10:39,289 --> 02:10:42,758
<i>and indeed, for
international space travel.</i>

1858
02:10:42,759 --> 02:10:45,162
I can't believe
anything you do works.

1859
02:10:45,163 --> 02:10:46,596
Hey!

1860
02:10:48,465 --> 02:10:49,699
Oh, God.

1861
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,469
I can't believe it.

1862
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:54,303
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

1863
02:10:54,304 --> 02:10:58,074
I know. I haven't had a
shower in a year and a half.

1864
02:10:58,075 --> 02:11:00,478
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

1865
02:11:34,312 --> 02:11:35,680
Hey, there.

1866
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:46,122
- Morning, sir.
- It's an honor, sir.

1867
02:11:46,123 --> 02:11:48,025
Sir.

1868
02:11:48,026 --> 02:11:49,825
- Sir.
- Sir.

1869
02:11:49,826 --> 02:11:51,261
Morning, sir.

1870
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:15,718
<i>Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.</i>

1871
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:17,787
Now pay attention,

1872
02:12:17,788 --> 02:12:19,922
because this could save your life.

1873
02:12:19,923 --> 02:12:21,523
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

1874
02:12:22,959 --> 02:12:25,061
Let me get a few things out
of the way, right off the bat.

1875
02:12:25,062 --> 02:12:28,599
Yes, I did in fact survive
on a deserted planet

1876
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,768
by farming in my own shit.

1877
02:12:31,936 --> 02:12:34,570
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.

1878
02:12:34,571 --> 02:12:36,373
So let's not talk about that ever again.

1879
02:12:37,775 --> 02:12:40,843
The other question I
get most frequently is...

1880
02:12:40,844 --> 02:12:43,579
"When I was up there, stranded by myself...

1881
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:46,216
"did I think I was going to die?"

1882
02:12:46,217 --> 02:12:47,851
Yes, absolutely.

1883
02:12:49,087 --> 02:12:50,486
And that's what you need to know going in

1884
02:12:50,487 --> 02:12:52,555
because it's going to happen to you.

1885
02:12:52,556 --> 02:12:56,325
This is space. It does not cooperate.

1886
02:12:56,326 --> 02:12:58,994
At some point, everything
is going to go south on you.

1887
02:12:58,995 --> 02:13:00,297
Everything is going to go south

1888
02:13:00,298 --> 02:13:01,931
and you're going to say, "This is it.

1889
02:13:01,932 --> 02:13:03,801
"This is how I end."

1890
02:13:05,035 --> 02:13:07,203
Now, you can either accept that...

1891
02:13:07,204 --> 02:13:09,372
or you can get to work.

1892
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:12,075
That's all it is.

1893
02:13:12,076 --> 02:13:14,177
You just begin.

1894
02:13:14,844 --> 02:13:17,881
You do the math. You solve one problem...

1895
02:13:17,882 --> 02:13:19,582
then you solve the next one.

1896
02:13:19,583 --> 02:13:20,851
And then the next.

1897
02:13:20,852 --> 02:13:21,885
And if you solve enough problems,

1898
02:13:21,886 --> 02:13:23,753
you get to come home.

1899
02:13:24,387 --> 02:13:26,590
All right, questions?

1900
02:13:31,795 --> 02:13:32,962
<i>Once Mission Control completes</i>

1901
02:13:32,963 --> 02:13:34,096
<i>their pre-flight checks...</i>

1902
02:13:34,097 --> 02:13:36,466
<i>we'll begin launch procedures.</i>

1903
02:13:36,467 --> 02:13:38,935
<i>The</i> Ares 5 <i>team will
rendezvous with the</i> Hermes...

1904
02:13:38,936 --> 02:13:42,138
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1905
02:13:42,139 --> 02:13:44,140
From there, they will have 414 days

1906
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:46,175
of space travel ahead of them.

1907
02:13:46,176 --> 02:13:47,444
<i>Have the goals changed</i>

1908
02:13:47,445 --> 02:13:48,944
<i>from the previous mission...</i>

1909
02:13:48,945 --> 02:13:50,579
<i>to the</i> Ares 5 <i>program?</i>

1910
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:52,615
<i>And what do you hope to
achieve this time around?</i>

1911
02:13:52,616 --> 02:13:54,350
<i>Well, no. The goals
have always been the same</i>

1912
02:13:54,351 --> 02:13:55,853
for the <i>Ares</i> program.

1913
02:13:56,788 --> 02:13:58,187
This time, of course, we hope to bring

1914
02:13:58,188 --> 02:13:59,828
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1915
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:01,658

1916
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:02,827
Copy, Guidance.

1917
02:14:04,129 --> 02:14:05,761
This is Flight.

1918
02:14:05,762 --> 02:14:07,797
We are go for launch, on schedule.

1919
02:14:18,441 --> 02:14:19,574
