2
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,421
Okay.

3
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,383
Okay, I know, I know. I'm sorry.

4
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,218
I know it's a little tender.

5
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,429
Hmm.

6
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,769
Okay, let's try your voice now.

7
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,941
My name is Katniss Everdeen. I'm from District 12.

8
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,073
- "My...
- Okay, take your time.

9
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,742
Still got a lot of swelling in your vocal chords.

10
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,245
"My...

11
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:22,333
name is...

12
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:26,629
Katniss Everdeen."

13
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,719
I want...

14
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,014
I want to talk to him.

15
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,309
He needs time.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,230
But, um, we're trying somethin' new today.

17
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,524
He's been calmer with the doctors,

18
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,694
but they're strangers to him.

19
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,738
So we're gonna test his response

20
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,781
on someone he remembers from home.

21
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,659
Someone he trusts.

22
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,340
Send her in.

23
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,394
Hey.

24
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,104
Prim.

25
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,856
How you feelin'?

26
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,068
- She's too close.
- Mmm, it's okay.

27
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,445
- How'd you get here?
- We live in District 13 now.

28
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,198
It's a real place. Stories are true.

29
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,158
You were rescued.

30
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,911
My family hasn't come to see me.

31
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,376
There was an attack on 12.

32
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,669
Yes.

33
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,213
My family?

34
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,926
The bakery didn't survive.

35
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,318
It's Katniss.

36
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,989
- It's because of Katniss.
- Wasn't because of her.

37
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,534
- She tell you to say that?
- She didn't tell me anything.

38
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,912
She's a liar, Prim. It's a trick.

39
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,290
Peeta, what you're saying isn't real.

40
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,505
She sent you here to talk to me.

41
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,965
- She knows you're here now.
- It's okay.

42
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,008
She knows... You can't trust her!

43
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:37,552
She's a monster!

44
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,179
She's a mutt that The Capitol created to destroy us!

45
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,223
- Get her outta there.
- Do you understand me?

46
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:46,102
You have to kill her, Prim! You have to kill her!

47
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,438
- Katniss?
- She's a mutt!

48
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,316
This is just a conditioned response.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,152
- Kill her!
- It's not him.

50
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,737
She's a monster! She's a mutt!

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,697
- No, it's not him.
- She's a mutt!

52
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,625
There's not enough manpower coming in from 4.

53
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,252
I don't think that's a problem.

54
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,336
Please, come in.

55
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,422
With any kind of manpower, if we...

56
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,090
Will you excuse us for just a moment?

57
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,633
Of course.

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,303
Have a seat.

59
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,058
I'm glad you're feeling better.

60
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,359
Snow has to pay for what he's done.

61
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,445
I wanna help the rebels in any way I can.

62
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,946
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

63
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,406
That's not Peeta.

64
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,827
Send me to The Capitol. I'll do anything.

65
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,162
I can't...

66
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,544
I can't send you there.

67
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,465
We can't get into The Capitol until we control District 2.

68
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,674
Then send me to 2.

69
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,886
You want me to fire up our troops?

70
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,096
Call out to the loyalists? You've seen what I can do.

71
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,017
Yes, I have.

72
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,436
I saw Peeta... before we left.

73
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,105
And what did you think?

74
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,024
Something selfish.

75
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:02,655
That you don't have to be jealous of him anymore.

76
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,366
No.

77
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,247
I don't stand a chance if he doesn't get better.

78
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,500
You'll never let him go.

79
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,608
What's going' on in your head?

80
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,778
I don't know.

81
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,197
That's like kissing someone who's drunk.

82
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,408
Doesn't count.

83
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,586
30 minutes until touchdown.

84
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,879
Prepare for landing.

85
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,303
Wrap it up. Cut the chatter. Let's go.

86
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,181
This is another version of booby-trapping a resource.

87
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,849
- Right, I see.
- This one's designed to blind.

88
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,101
Smoke clings to the eyes.

89
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,520
That's an application of the hummingbird trap.

90
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,522
You scare people so they flee in this direction

91
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,691
into what they think is a safe haven.

92
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,234
Two-tiered explosion.

93
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,946
You allow people enough time to rush in, help the wounded, then...

94
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,657
- A second bomb.
- Right.

95
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,825
Second one goes off here.

96
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,452
I guess there are no rules anymore about

97
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,287
what a person can do to another person.

98
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,376
I don't think Snow used any rulebook when he hijacked Peeta.

99
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,816
Welcome to District 2. I'm Corporal Homes.

100
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,484
You follow me, please.

101
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:12,702
Don't worry.

102
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,162
It's just how the loyalists say "Good morning."

103
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:16,914
President Coin, we're indebted to you

104
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,000
for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay.

105
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,044
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2

106
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,587
knows what we've been up against.

107
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,006
This is The Nut.

108
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,718
The Capitol's headquarters for all offensive operations.

109
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,511
It's manned by both military

110
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,638
and civilian personnel from District 2.

111
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,348
As you can see,

112
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:38,102
the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock, it's untouchable.

113
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,646
Yesterday, we attempted to take the northeastern gate.

114
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,358
The enemy countered from higher up and we were forced to pull back.

115
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,986
We took heavy losses.

116
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,780
Could we create a decoy? Send troops towards one gate,

117
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,991
launch a staggered attack on another.

118
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,993
Whose troops do you propose as a decoy, commander?

119
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,538
We have the Mockingjay. Don't underestimate her.

120
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,665
We could use her to erode support.

121
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,334
She may be able to sway some of the loyalists.

122
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,755
You've been underground a long time, Madam Coin.

123
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,673
This isn't like the rest of Panem.

124
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,009
Support for The Capitol runs deep here.

125
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,553
Then there is no sacrifice too great.

126
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:17,683
We need to control the arsenal inside that fortress.

127
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,061
Even with every district in this alliance,

128
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,687
we are outgunned.

129
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,439
I won't commit my people to a ground assault

130
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,899
just to pillage weapons.

131
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,859
Commander Paylor, your people have suffered

132
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,153
more than just about anyone else at the hands of The Capitol.

133
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,821
Which is why I won't condone a mass suicide.

134
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,574
If we don't take District 2, we won't get into The Capitol.

135
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,453
Would it be enough to disable the fortress... instead of taking it?

136
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,663
What do you have in mind?

137
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,084
You think of it like a wolf den.

138
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,961
You're not gonna fight your way in, so you've got two choices:

139
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,714
You trap the wolves inside, or you flush 'em out.

140
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,132
If we can't attack straight on,

141
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,342
then couldn't we use our hovercraft

142
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,260
to strike around it? We'll use the mountains.

143
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,470
We'll hit weak spots in the peaks.

144
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,014
We could design the bomb targets in sequence using seismic data.

145
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,474
Trigger avalanches.

146
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,101
Block all exits, cut off their supplies.

147
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,853
You make it impossible for them to launch their hovercraft.

148
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,688
Bury them alive.

149
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,066
We'd forfeit any chance to control the weapons.

150
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,692
Yes, but we'd face a weakened Capitol.

151
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,402
There's civilians in there.

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,447
They should be given a chance to surrender.

153
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,908
Could use one of the supply tunnels for the evacuees.

154
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,536
It's a luxury we weren't given when they firebombed 12.

155
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,704
There's gotta be a better way.

156
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:24,959
I suggest we try the avalanche, but leave the train tunnel alone.

157
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,961
Civilians can escape into the square,

158
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,838
where our armies will be waiting for their surrender.

159
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,298
We should have every available medic standing by.

160
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,175
And if they won't surrender?

161
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,053
Then we will need a compelling voice...

162
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,888
to persuade them.

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,573
Red flag, this is blue leader.

164
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,159
Form up on Charlie Tango, 1,500 meters out.

165
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,791
All bombers are outbound.

166
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,878
What's the difference, Katniss?

167
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,296
Crushing the enemy in a mine

168
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,214
or blowing' them outta the sky with one of Beetee's arrows.

169
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,424
It's the same thing.

170
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,759
We were under attack in District 8,

171
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,263
and that hovercraft wasn't filled with civilians.

172
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,931
Doesn't matter.

173
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,850
Even if those civilians are just mopping' floors,

174
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,476
they're helping the enemy.

175
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,354
And if they have to die, I can live with that.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
No one who supports The Capitol is innocent.

177
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,735
With that kinda thinking, you can kill whoever you want.

178
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,320
You can send kids off to The Hunger Games

179
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,779
to keep the districts in line.

180
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,162
It's war, Katniss.

181
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,290
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,668
Figured if anyone knew that, it was you.

183
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,880
I, of all people, know that it's always personal.

184
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,126
Don't worry, Katniss, there'll be survivors.

185
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,837
Let's focus on what it is you gotta say.

186
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,798
Now, Plutarch wrote a speech for you...

187
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,882
I'm not saying that.

188
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,510
Okay. Didn't think so. Let's, uh...

189
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,680
But just remember, you're talking to everybody.

190
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,015
Not just the rebels, but The Capitol,

191
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,976
the survivors in 2.

192
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,270
We want them to lay down their arms.

193
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,771
So you might wanna experiment

194
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,107
with a little sensitivity, warmth.

195
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,526
Make it quick, you're exposed.

196
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,344
This is Katniss Everdeen,

197
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,097
speaking to all of the loyalists from the heart of District 2.

198
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,598
Survivors! Inbound!

199
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,559
Ready! Ready! Guns up!

200
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,813
On the ready. Guns up!

201
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,357
We gotta get you back.

202
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,609
Here they come!

203
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,529
Weapons tight! Weapons tight!

204
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,074
Everybody, stand by!

205
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,830
On the ground!

206
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,957
Put your weapons down.

207
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,751
Get on the ground!

208
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,961
Put your weapons down now!

209
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,130
Weapons down!

210
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,258
You! Put it down!

211
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,052
Put it...

212
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,887
- Put your weapons down!
- Drop it!

213
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,848
Drop your weapon! You! Drop it.

214
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,392
Drop the gun!

215
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,894
Drop it!

216
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,354
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

217
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,064
Stop!

218
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,232
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

219
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,109
- Hold your fire!
- He needs help!

220
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,736
Hold your fire!

221
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,905
Drop it!

222
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,493
Give me one reason I shouldn't shoot you.

223
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,660
Drop the gun!

224
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,338
I can't.

225
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,967
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

226
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,263
We blew up your mine.

227
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,725
You burned my district to the ground.

228
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,230
We each have every reason to want to kill each other.

229
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,109
So if you wanna kill me, do it.

230
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,987
Make Snow happy.

231
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,032
I'm tired of killing his slaves for him.

232
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,285
I'm not his slave.

233
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,413
I am.

234
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,165
That's why I killed Cato.

235
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,960
And he killed Thresh.

236
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,504
And Thresh killed Clove.

237
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,925
It just goes around and around.

238
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,135
And who wins?

239
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,555
Always Snow.

240
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:34,101
I am done being a piece in his game.

241
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,439
District 12, District 2. We have no fight.

242
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,942
Except the one The Capitol gave us.

243
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,655
Why are you fighting the rebels?

244
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,699
You're neighbors.

245
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,452
You're family.

246
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:15,976
These people are not your enemy.

247
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,062
We all have one enemy.

248
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,690
And that's Snow.

249
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,570
He corrupts everyone and everything.

250
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,699
He turns the best of us against each other.

251
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,120
Stop killing for him.

252
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:42,169
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

253
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,049
Turn your weapons to Snow.

254
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:54,515
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

255
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,144
Turn your weapons to Snow.

256
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,315
Hold your fire.

257
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,656
A toast.

258
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,749
Antonius, with our best troops crushed in the mountains

259
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,794
and the rebels marching on us as we speak,

260
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,420
what did we celebrate?

261
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,883
The death of the Mockingjay, sir.

262
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,761
If Peeta didn't kill her, her own arrogance did.

263
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,487
Of course.

264
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,407
That's the same facile thinking

265
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,411
that led you to divert our best Peacekeepers into District 2.

266
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,040
You have a habit of burying people before they're dead.

267
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,293
If the Mockingjay were gone,

268
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,588
the rebels would already be using her as a martyr.

269
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,842
No, Minister Antonius,

270
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:16,054
I'm afraid that is not what we were toasting at all.

271
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,850
Sir, the rebels can be held off out...

272
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,773
The rebels will reach the outskirts of The Capitol

273
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,734
in a matter of days.

274
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:34,239
We'll evacuate the outer blocks to let them in.

275
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,368
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

276
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,912
so we're secure from the skies.

277
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,915
Lure them into the city,

278
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,126
and then our Gamemakers

279
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,129
will make them pay for every inch with blood.

280
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:53,342
I want every camera watching.

281
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,012
We'll turn their advance into a celebration of suffering.

282
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,684
Let each moment be captured for all posterity.

283
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,900
So, what did we toast tonight, Minister Antonius?

284
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,155
We toasted a glorious era...

285
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,993
coming to its bitter end.

286
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:31,046
Well, there she is. The Mockingjay.

287
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:36,051
Oh, that speech you gave. Oh, man, feel.

288
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,387
I mean, I still have goose bumps.

289
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,890
You don't mind, do you?

290
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,892
They cut off my supply of morphling.

291
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,395
There's this head doctor that comes in and sees me every day,

292
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,522
trying to help me adjust to reality.

293
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,192
Like some guy from this rabbit's warren

294
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,361
actually knows anything about my reality.

295
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,911
At least 20 times in a session, he tells me that I'm totally safe.

296
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,997
Safe from The Capitol.

297
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,083
Safe from Snow.

298
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,505
What about you, Mockingjay? You feeling totally safe?

299
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,425
- Till I got shot.
- Oh, please.

300
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,593
The bullet didn't even touch you.

301
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,930
Cinna saw to that. Of course, your costume would be bulletproof.

302
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,057
So what are your injuries?

303
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,562
Bruised ribs, bruised lung.

304
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,231
I'm surprised they haven't found you a new lung.

305
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,025
I mean, I've got two. Do you want one of mine?

306
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,904
I mean, it's everybody's job to keep you alive.

307
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,824
- Is that why you hate me?
- Partly.

308
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,535
You're also a little hard to swallow.

309
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,537
The whole tacky romance drama

310
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,831
and the "defender of the hopeless" act.

311
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,750
Even though it's not an act.

312
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,918
Which makes it even more unbearable.

313
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,380
Feel free to take any of this personally.

314
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,257
You should have been the Mockingjay.

315
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,884
Nobody else would tell you what to say.

316
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,719
But nobody likes me.

317
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,307
- They're afraid of you.
- Maybe here,

318
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,351
but... in The Capitol, you're the only thing

319
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,936
that they're scared of.

320
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,068
It's just stuff my family brought.

321
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,123
It's from Peeta.

322
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,834
Yeah.

323
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,927
They messed us up pretty good, didn't they?

324
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,098
We showed him footage of your speech in 2.

325
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,475
He had real memories of you.

326
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,769
That still doesn't mean I'm going in there.

327
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,521
He's strapped down. He can't hurt you.

328
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,357
No. This is different. Haymitch, I really don't want to.

329
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,818
It doesn't matter what you want. It's for Peeta.

330
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,904
What's the harm in trying?

331
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,006
I watched you die.

332
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,137
- You look terrible.
- You've looked better.

333
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,889
You're not even remotely nice to say that to me now.

334
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,475
I was never the nice one. You were.

335
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,566
When I saw you die, I remembered something.

336
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,526
About the bread.

337
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,989
I remember... you in the rain.

338
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,784
And I burned it on purpose.

339
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,162
To give it to you.

340
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,294
I remember my mother hitting me.

341
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,130
I was supposed to give it to the pig.

342
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,632
That was the first we'd eaten in days.

343
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,468
Why would I take a beating like that for you?

344
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:09,514
Because you were kind and generous.

345
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,811
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you love me?

346
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:20,233
They said that's why Snow tortured you. To hurt me.

347
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,652
Snow says that everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie.

348
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,616
All I know is that I would have

349
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,284
saved myself a lot of suffering,

350
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,704
if I'd just given that bread to the pig.

351
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,146
I think the only thing left to say is "thank you."

352
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,650
I need to be in The Capitol.

353
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,693
No, you have done your job.

354
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,237
You've been very successful as the Mockingjay.

355
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:10,325
You've unified the districts. And now we want you to rest.

356
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,327
And to heal.

357
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,663
The last the rebels saw me, I was lying on the ground.

358
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,499
Katniss, we won't let this momentum go to waste.

359
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,251
We'll shoot more propos right here in 13,

360
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,878
showing them that you're alive.

361
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,129
I should be with the troops.

362
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,256
It'll be like being on the front lines.

363
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,633
As far as the soldiers know,

364
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,678
you survived a bullet to the heart.

365
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,138
I think they'll understand why you're not with them.

366
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,182
When we win this war,

367
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,559
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

368
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,019
We'll need you for the ceremony.

369
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,105
You're very valuable to us.

370
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,653
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

371
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:51,825
From this day forth, in sickness and in health,

372
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,911
for richer or poorer.

373
00:24:55,495 --> 00:25:00,041
I promise to love and cherish you each day.

374
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,336
I, Finnick Odair,

375
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:08,216
take you, Annie Cresta, as my wife from this day forth.

376
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:13,972
Together or apart, we will always be united.

377
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:19,102
One life, one purpose, one destiny.

378
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,770
You may kiss the bride.

379
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,144
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

380
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,189
Did you tell him "Hi" for me?

381
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,274
We're old friends, you know.

382
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,234
We had adjoining cells in The Capitol.

383
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,904
We're very familiar with each other's screams.

384
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,449
I'm going to kill Snow.

385
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,205
Nothing good is safe while he's alive.

386
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,500
And I can't make another speech about it.

387
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,505
No more cameras. No more propos.

388
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,257
No more games.

389
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,888
He needs to see my eyes when I kill him.

390
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,187
Now you're talking.

391
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,109
Find a way to The Capitol

392
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,277
when everybody's looking the other way.

393
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:52,946
I hear the medics talking.

394
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,697
They're shipping supplies for the front line

395
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,699
from hangar two around midnight tonight.

396
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,743
Medicine, painkillers.

397
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,745
I was gonna go steal some for myself,

398
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:05,750
but I guess I could just stay here and cover for you.

399
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,047
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss. Even a president.

400
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,467
You just have to be willing to sacrifice yourself.

401
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,059
Go on.

402
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,478
Don't you want Snow to see you dance?

403
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,811
Hey, that's her.

404
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,572
That's Katniss Everdeen.

405
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,476
Hey. Thought you were in the hospital.

406
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,852
I was.

407
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,313
Come on.

408
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,856
What is she doing?

409
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,610
I don't know, it's so frustrating when she goes rogue.

410
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,905
This isn't just adolescent, it's insubordination.

411
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,532
Put her on the first hovercraft back.

412
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,868
Don't be ridiculous. She can't come back now.

413
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,496
She's mythic.

414
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,459
At the front lines, surviving a gunshot wound.

415
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,420
Couldn't have staged it better myself.

416
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,006
Hmm. I know.

417
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,886
She's going to stay where she is.

418
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,309
And whatever she's doing, we conceived it.

419
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,686
It was our plan all along.

420
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,065
Of course it was.

421
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:44,028
Mr. Heavensbee, you're the Gamemaker.

422
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,907
I want everyone to know, whatever game she's playing,

423
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,325
she's playing for us.

424
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,922
I'm Commander Paylor of District 8.

425
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:07,135
I'm a soldier, like all of you, so here's what I know.

426
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,095
For the first time in our lifetimes,

427
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,848
we're standing together with 13 districts.

428
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,059
From what I see here, we've already made history.

429
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,817
But history doesn't stop to celebrate.

430
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,569
And we're facing an enemy that will not change

431
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,612
and will never surrender.

432
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,489
President Snow has pulled back Peacekeepers

433
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,033
to fortify the center of the city.

434
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,786
He's evacuating residents from the outer blocks.

435
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,164
These civilians will be confused and desperate.

436
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,749
You are under orders not to target them.

437
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,378
We're deploying medical brigades to help anyone in need.

438
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,840
We'll show The Capitol people who we are.

439
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,633
To slow our advance, President Snow

440
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,011
is building a minefield of traps

441
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,889
and lethal devices called "pods."

442
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,891
The sadistic inventions of Gamemakers

443
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,268
meant to make sport of our deaths.

444
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,480
If our armies make it past Peacekeepers and other defenses,

445
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,815
we'll converge in the center of the city at Snow's mansion,

446
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,609
where we won't just unlock his gates,

447
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,777
but unshackle all of Panem.

448
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:16,287
If we die, let it be for a cause and not a spectacle.

449
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,040
If we succeed, let it be for all of Panem,

450
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,833
and let it be forever.

451
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:24,003
Yes, you've already made history.

452
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:29,884
But the future, our future, starts tomorrow at dawn,

453
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,428
when we march together into The Capitol.

454
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,738
Squad 451?

455
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,830
Looks like you got your meals covered.

456
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,459
- Trying' to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

457
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,878
We've been hunting together all our lives.

458
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,756
I know when you're gonna go off on your own.

459
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,221
You gonna leave me behind, too?

460
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,847
As your fellow soldier,

461
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,810
I suggest that you stay with your unit.

462
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,523
But I couldn't stop you if you wanted to come.

463
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:30,111
Hawthorne, Everdeen, come meet your new unit.

464
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,452
I'm Lieutenant Jackson,

465
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,538
and I wanna introduce you to your squad.

466
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,541
This is Second Lieutenant Mitchell,

467
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,585
best sharpshooter in Panem.

468
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,754
These are the Leeg sisters. First Combat Division.

469
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,215
And this is Corporal Homes.

470
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,635
Finnick?

471
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,514
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

472
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,099
That was a short honeymoon.

473
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,602
Yeah, well,

474
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,479
I guess we're gonna have to have one in The Capitol.

475
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:07,356
- After we take it.
- Gather 'round.

476
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:16,449
Squad 451, you're my unit.

477
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,118
Lieutenant Jackson is my second-in-command.

478
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,705
Each one of you is elite in some form of combat.

479
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,041
But we are a non-combat unit.

480
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,585
So we'll be following days behind the front-line troops.

481
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,880
You're to be the onscreen faces of the invasion.

482
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,174
"The Star Squad."

483
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,259
It's been decided that you're most effective

484
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,303
- when seen by the masses.
- So we're not gonna fight?

485
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,180
You'll do whatever you're ordered to do, soldier.

486
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,389
It's not your job to ask questions.

487
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,183
Yes, sir.

488
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,769
Our instructions are to shoot propaganda footage

489
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,396
on the battle-scarred streets of The Capitol.

490
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,857
You were handpicked to intimidate their forces.

491
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,776
And inspire surrenders.

492
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,694
Even though we'll be working on abandoned streets

493
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,154
miles behind the front lines,

494
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,822
I guarantee you, wherever they put us,

495
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,034
it will not be safe. This is a war zone.

496
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,703
It is likely that we'll encounter both active pods

497
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,538
and Peacekeepers.

498
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,667
You're considered high-value targets to The Capitol.

499
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,335
In the event of capture,

500
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,253
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

501
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,588
A poison that acts immediately.

502
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,882
Lieutenant Jackson, do the honors.

503
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,093
I've already briefed you on the pods.

504
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,762
I remind you, they are on every block.

505
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,890
Our unit has been given a Holo.

506
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:28,062
A database that contains a detailed map of The Capitol

507
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,189
and a list of every known pod.

508
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,025
These pods can trigger anything from bombs

509
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,486
to traps to mutts.

510
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,571
We cannot move without this device.

511
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:39,865
There's no guarantee that our database is complete.

512
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,784
There could be new pods that we're not aware of.

513
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,327
Because we don't want the Gamemakers to know

514
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:46,372
we have this intel, it has a self-destruct on it.

515
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,791
You flip this switch, say "nightlock" three times,

516
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,585
and it blows itself and anything within a 10-foot radius.

517
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,630
Stay within our unit.

518
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,215
Even with the Holo,

519
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,218
it is likely that new pods have been set.

520
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,304
Whatever they contain, they are meant to kill you.

521
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,975
Ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,894
welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

523
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,507
I've never seen this place so empty.

524
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,092
Just keep your eyes open.

525
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,159
Got a pod. Let's take cover.

526
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,334
Shoot through those two buildings.

527
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:20,299
Pollux... right here.

528
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:21,675
Castor.

529
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,598
Good.

530
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,522
When you're ready, Katniss.

531
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,447
Hold it. Pollux, tighter.

532
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay.

533
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,065
All clear.

534
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,361
I don't think we can get across this minefield.

535
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,698
Not without that Holo.

536
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,534
We're not gonna get it off him while he's awake.

537
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,953
Let's make sure we're on the same watch tonight.

538
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,918
Is that Peacekeepers?

539
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,467
451 to base.

540
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,761
We've got a truck coming in from the south. Over.

541
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,390
Copy that. Over.

542
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,143
Stand down, everyone. It's friendly.

543
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:34,725
My name is Peeta Mellark.

544
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,976
My home is District 12.

545
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,607
My name is Peeta Mellark. My home is District 12.

546
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,567
- Okay, stop.
- My name is Peeta Mellark.

547
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,820
- Hold up. Everyone relax.
- My home is District 12.

548
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,238
What are we doing'?

549
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,532
Jackson, cuff him.

550
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,751
Soldier, this is just a precaution

551
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,836
till we can get everything straightened out. Yeah?

552
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,925
My name's Peeta Mellark. From District 12.

553
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,554
They want us to add him to the propo.

554
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,640
Show that he's on our side now.

555
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,685
We'll move forward a few blocks tomorrow

556
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:19,103
and shoot the new footage.

557
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,646
He's not in control of himself.

558
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,565
I say we schedule an around-the-clock watch on him.

559
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:27,403
The Leegs till 1700, Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

560
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,071
Give me a watch.

561
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:31,949
And if it really came down to it,

562
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,283
you think you could shoot him?

563
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,160
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.

564
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,579
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

565
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,123
I'm not sure that kind of a comment

566
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,041
recommends you for the job, either, soldier.

567
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,293
Put her in the rotation.

568
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,277
He's gonna try to kill me.

569
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,737
Especially with all this going on.

570
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,321
It's gonna set him off.

571
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,906
We'll keep him contained.

572
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,534
Why would Coin do this?

573
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:20,956
Here's all I know.

574
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,794
It was Peeta that she wanted rescued from the arena.

575
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,755
She never liked you.

576
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,424
She doesn't like anybody or anything she can't control.

577
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,634
So she would put my life in danger?

578
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,470
She'd deny it, but...

579
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,555
What?

580
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,682
One way or another, this war is gonna come to an end.

581
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,268
They promised a free election.

582
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,938
Maybe she's starting' to see you as a threat.

583
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,484
Nobody would think I'd be a leader.

584
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,235
But you'd throw your support to someone.

585
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,904
Would it be her?

586
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,617
And if your immediate answer isn't "yes,"

587
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,452
then you're dangerous.

588
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,288
She doesn't need you as a rallying cry anymore.

589
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,207
These propos can be done without you.

590
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,792
There's only one thing you could do now

591
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,376
to add more fire to this rebellion.

592
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,921
Die.

593
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:11,423
That's not gonna happen under my watch, Katniss.

594
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,177
I'm planning' for you to have a long life.

595
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,055
Why? You don't owe me anything.

596
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,308
Because you've earned it.

597
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,114
We've been here before, you know.

598
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,950
What?

599
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:40,119
That look.

600
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,871
I've seen that look.

601
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,043
You're trying to decide

602
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:49,670
whether or not you should kill me.

603
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,922
I never wanted to kill you.

604
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,009
And that's not what I'm doing.

605
00:43:56,093 --> 00:44:00,264
I saw it with my own eyes. In the first Games.

606
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:01,598
In the first Games, I thought you were

607
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,350
trying to help the Careers kill me.

608
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:10,023
After that, I always saw you... As an ally.

609
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,821
Friend, lover...

610
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:17,948
Victor...

611
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,746
Enemy, target, mutt.

612
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,707
And now ally?

613
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,458
Yeah, I'll add that to the list of words

614
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,294
I use to try to figure you out.

615
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:36,383
I'm sorry.

616
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:44,057
I just can't tell what's real and what's made up anymore.

617
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:47,311
Then ask. It's what Annie does.

618
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:48,854
Ask who?

619
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:52,024
Us. We're your unit now.

620
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,411
Your favorite color is green.

621
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,247
Is that real?

622
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,377
Yeah. That's real.

623
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,380
Yours is orange.

624
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,552
Not bright orange.

625
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,056
Soft, like the sunset.

626
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,475
Thank you.

627
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,107
You're a painter.

628
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,361
You're a baker.

629
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,115
You always sleep with the windows open.

630
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,287
You never take sugar in your tea.

631
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,375
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

632
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,046
You were right.

633
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,342
I can't do this.

634
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,396
Guess we're not leaving' anymore.

635
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,067
We're not going anywhere without that Holo.

636
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,486
Listen up.

637
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,656
Mag's empty.

638
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,828
It's only for the propo.

639
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,502
Let's move. We're headed five blocks north.

640
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,934
"To the citizens of The Capitol,

641
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:52,644
our war is not with you."

642
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,021
To the citizens of The Capitol,

643
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:56,982
our war is not with you.

644
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,942
"You will be a vital part of the democracy

645
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,360
that follows our victory."

646
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,321
Be a vital part of the democracy

647
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,281
that follows our victory.

648
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,450
- You got it.
- Okay.

649
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:28,513
Boggs. This is a good spot.

650
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:31,308
Through there, in the courtyard.

651
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,893
Okay, let us clear it.

652
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,747
Got a pod.

653
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,333
Split. Take cover.

654
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,889
Stay back.

655
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,084
All clear. Gale, Homes, with me.

656
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,919
Leegs, take the wings.

657
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,612
Everdeen, no!

658
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:08,738
Boggs!

659
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:11,199
- Hold your position!
- Boggs!

660
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,826
Grab the tourniquets from the bag.

661
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,662
Squeeze his legs as hard as you can.

662
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:16,788
It's okay.

663
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:18,874
The Holo. The Holo.

664
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,628
Unfit for command.

665
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:25,630
Transfer primary security clearance...

666
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,048
Say your name.

667
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,009
Katniss Everdeen.

668
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,219
What did you just do?

669
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,639
Katniss, don't trust them.

670
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,683
Kill Peeta, if you have to.

671
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:41,229
- Do what you came to do.
- Boggs? Boggs?

672
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:58,163
- Come on. Come on.
- He's gone. He's gone.

673
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,904
Go, go, go!

674
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,616
- This way!
- Keep moving.

675
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,035
Let's go, soldiers!

676
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,829
- Get to higher ground!
- Move!

677
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:47,629
Finnick!

678
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,259
- Peeta!
- Mitchell!

679
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:55,262
Come on, come on!

680
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,930
Settle!

681
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:59,349
Come on! Don't stop! Let's go!

682
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,184
Come on, come on! We gotta move!

683
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:02,602
Get inside!

684
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:08,191
Everybody, inside! Go! Upstairs! Go! Hurry up!

685
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:09,276
Move!

686
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,364
- Go! Go!
- Move!

687
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,328
Keep moving!

688
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,873
Keep moving to the top!

689
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,292
Go!

690
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,554
Hey, hey! I got you.

691
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:48,023
It's slowing down.

692
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,165
Gamemakers are still putting on quite a show.

693
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:10,128
- 451 to base. Over.
- Hey, we better move.

694
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,672
If Peacekeepers didn't know where we were, they do now.

695
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:15,133
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

696
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,719
451 to base. Come in.

697
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,513
This is a bad spot. We need to move now.

698
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,141
451 to base. Over.

699
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,728
I can't get a signal.

700
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,856
But I can get us back to base. Everdeen, give me the Holo.

701
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,653
Everdeen, what did I just say? The Holo. Come on, let's go.

702
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:37,155
Boggs gave it to me.

703
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:39,449
What are you talking about?

704
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,202
He did. He transferred security clearance to her.

705
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,453
I saw him.

706
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,374
And why would he do that?

707
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,752
I'm on special orders from Coin.

708
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,629
To do what?

709
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,547
To assassinate President Snow.

710
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:01,262
I don't believe that for one second.

711
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,556
As your new unit commander,

712
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,559
I order you to transfer security clearance to me now.

713
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,728
I can't do that.

714
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,734
Let's not lose our heads here.

715
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:21,116
I'm not asking you again, Everdeen.

716
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,909
Give me that Holo.

717
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:29,040
She's telling the truth. Plutarch wants it televised.

718
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,667
He thinks if we could film

719
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,585
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

720
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,170
it'll make The Capitol surrender

721
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:36,297
before the casualties get too high.

722
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:37,590
While we're arguing,

723
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:39,259
there's 100 Peacekeepers on their way here.

724
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:45,306
Boggs promised me that when the time came,

725
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,766
you would help me.

726
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,786
All right, soldier, Holo's yours.

727
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,592
I don't think we're gonna leave any footprints.

728
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,719
We should move now. And those cameras outside

729
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:23,845
should be covered up by the oil.

730
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,305
She can't move forward like this.

731
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:28,975
Her leg is too bad. We have to evacuate her.

732
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,395
I'm sorry.

733
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:34,481
I'll stay with her.

734
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,566
As soon as we make contact,

735
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,985
we will send somebody back. I promise you.

736
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,406
All right, everybody, move out.

737
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,033
- Let's get him up.
- Let's go!

738
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:48,203
Can you walk?

739
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,748
Come on, this way.

740
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,061
Get these curtains closed.

741
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:23,423
It's the Leegs.

742
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:51,618
Good afternoon. I'm Caesar Flickerman.

743
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,244
Here with our continuing coverage

744
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:56,205
of the defense of The Capitol.

745
00:56:56,289 --> 00:57:01,044
Today, as our Peacekeepers valiantly hold off the rebels,

746
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:04,923
our story takes a surprising twist.

747
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,842
Katniss Everdeen, our once favorite daughter,

748
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:09,802
has infiltrated the city

749
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:11,638
with some of the Victors,

750
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:13,973
whose names are all too familiar.

751
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:17,477
Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark.

752
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:23,191
Clearly, some alliances don't last forever.

753
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:27,904
Take a look at what happened just a moment ago,

754
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:31,032
when our Peacekeepers cornered Katniss Everdeen

755
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,701
and her band of foolish rebels.

756
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:35,411
Whatever arrogance

757
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:38,665
brought this treacherous girl back to us,

758
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:40,917
you are about to witness a great victory,

759
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,711
not only for The Capitol, but for Panem.

760
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:06,025
So there you have it.

761
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:09,195
Katniss Everdeen, the Girl on Fire,

762
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:12,073
a girl who inspired so much violence,

763
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:15,910
seems to have met a violent end herself.

764
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:20,164
Stay tuned for more information. Caesar Flickerman. Thank you.

765
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,167
So now that we're dead, what are we gonna do?

766
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:24,836
Isn't it obvious?

767
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,839
The next move is to kill me.

768
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,513
I murdered one of our squad members.

769
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:39,892
Katniss is right.

770
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,272
I'm a mutt.

771
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:48,067
And it's only a matter of time before I snap again.

772
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:52,030
I'm not in control.

773
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:57,201
I need a nightlock pill, so I can die when I need to.

774
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:59,620
If it gets to that point, I'll kill you myself.

775
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,348
I don't think I ever really understood

776
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,559
the Capitol until now.

777
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,853
You eat like this, you'll believe anything.

778
00:59:55,635 --> 01:00:00,056
So Katniss Everdeen, a poor unstable girl

779
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,390
with nothing but a small talent

780
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:05,186
with a bow and arrow, is dead.

781
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:08,731
Not a thinker, not a leader.

782
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:12,068
Simply a face plucked from the masses.

783
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,861
Was she valuable?

784
01:00:13,945 --> 01:00:17,240
She was extremely valuable to your rebellion

785
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:22,036
because you have no vision, no true leader among you.

786
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:25,248
You call yourselves an alliance.

787
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:27,834
But we saw what that means.

788
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:31,170
Your soldiers are at each other's throats.

789
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:39,011
Good evening. For those of you who don't know me,

790
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:42,014
please, allow me to introduce myself.

791
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:46,602
I am President Alma Coin, leader of the rebellion.

792
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:49,272
I have interrupted a broadcast from your President

793
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:53,317
in which he attempted to defame a brave young woman.

794
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:57,405
"A face picked from the masses," he called her.

795
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,489
Plucked.

796
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:04,245
As if a leader, a true leader, could be anything else.

797
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,914
I had the privilege of knowing

798
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:10,710
a small-town girl from the Seam in District 12

799
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:13,713
who survived the Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell

800
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,174
and rose up and turned

801
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:19,552
a nation of slaves into an army!

802
01:01:21,137 --> 01:01:23,306
Dead or alive, Katniss Everdeen

803
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,474
will remain the face of this revolution.

804
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,394
She will not have died for nothing.

805
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,730
I had no idea I meant so much to her.

806
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:34,150
Her vision and ours will be realized.

807
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:39,488
A free Panem with self-determination for all.

808
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:42,909
And in her memory, we will all find the strength

809
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:45,912
to rid Panem of its oppressors.

810
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:49,332
Thank you. And be safe.

811
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,421
Snow's in his mansion. Where is that?

812
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,054
That's us.

813
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:05,932
That's the City Circle.

814
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:09,310
It's at least 70, 75 blocks north.

815
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,772
- Seventy-five blocks?
- Uh-huh.

816
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:15,566
Nobody knows we're alive. This is our chance.

817
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,569
These buildings. Do these look over Snow's gardens?

818
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:20,363
- I...
- They do.

819
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,448
If he goes outside at all, I could get a clear shot.

820
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,617
We're getting ahead of ourselves here.

821
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,869
Whether they're looking for us or not, we are pinned down.

822
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:28,746
Hit that button. Scan for pods.

823
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,668
Just about every ten steps.

824
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:36,128
Yeah, that doesn't even show the new ones.

825
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:38,339
So we can't go anywhere in the streets.

826
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,966
And the rooftops are just as bad.

827
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,763
There might be another way.

828
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,688
My brother knows these tunnels really well.

829
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:58,067
He worked sanitation down here.

830
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,986
Right after they made him an Avox.

831
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:11,372
Hey. Hey.

832
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:16,877
You gonna be okay? Look at me. Look at me.

833
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,798
We're gonna get through this. I promise.

834
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:38,774
Took us five years to buy his way outta here.

835
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,818
He didn't see the sun once.

836
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:22,276
We're too exposed here.

837
01:04:47,093 --> 01:04:49,887
Sir, should I call for your doctor?

838
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:54,934
- What did you say?
- Shall I call for your doctor?

839
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,854
I hope you've wakened me for something more urgent

840
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,440
than an old man's health.

841
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:04,819
They survived. I don't know how.

842
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,987
We picked them up on a surveillance cam.

843
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,116
Let me see. I... I need to see for myself.

844
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:14,703
It's her.

845
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,206
It is her.

846
01:05:21,419 --> 01:05:24,130
The arena has moved underground.

847
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:44,733
Looks clear.

848
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,218
Everybody okay?

849
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:14,555
Yeah.

850
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,583
All right, everybody,

851
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,668
we're gonna stop here for a bit and get some rest, yeah?

852
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:48,923
I'll take first watch.

853
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,805
Hey, Peeta. Just tuck in there.

854
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:04,855
All right, settle in, everybody.

855
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:28,963
Katniss. Your watch.

856
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,781
You know, The Capitol,

857
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:58,492
they used tracker jacker venom on me.

858
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,830
That's what the doctors in 13 said.

859
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,124
You were stung once, too.

860
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:08,252
Real or not real?

861
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:11,630
Real.

862
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:14,633
When they used the venom on me,

863
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:17,303
they would show me pictures of my life.

864
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:21,807
But some weren't real.

865
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,184
They changed them.

866
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,233
At first, they all... They all blurred together.

867
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:35,779
But now... Now I can sort them out a little.

868
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:38,449
Like the ones that they changed,

869
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:41,035
they have this quality...

870
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:45,122
It's like they're shiny. They've been glossed over.

871
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:49,835
You should get some rest.

872
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,591
You're still trying to protect me.

873
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,176
Real or not real?

874
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:58,969
Real.

875
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:01,972
That's what you and I do.

876
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,434
Keep each other alive.

877
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:18,716
Katniss. Katniss. Katniss.

878
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:26,098
Katniss?

879
01:10:33,522 --> 01:10:35,315
What is that?

880
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,942
We gotta go. We gotta get outta here now.

881
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,111
- Keep your voice down.
- Mutts! They released mutts.

882
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,320
Pollux, what's the fastest way out?

883
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:42,030
Come on! Go! Go!

884
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:23,984
- Go! Go! Go! It's mutts!
- Come on, come on, come on!

885
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,611
Pollux, lead us out of here!

886
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:28,822
Come on!

887
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,337
Castor!

888
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,463
Castor!

889
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:52,346
Fall back!

890
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:55,349
Move!

891
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,897
Katniss, come on! Move!

892
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:40,954
Katniss!

893
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:01,933
Go, go, go, go, go!

894
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,324
Go, go, go!

895
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:27,084
Katniss!

896
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,243
- No!
- Finnick!

897
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,955
Finnick!

898
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,168
Katniss!

899
01:17:10,252 --> 01:17:14,798
Nightlock. Nightlock. Nightlock.

900
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:18,885
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's go.

901
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,011
Keep moving! Keep moving!

902
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:25,225
Ow!

903
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:36,987
Go! Go!

904
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,655
Keep going! Keep going!

905
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:12,731
Peeta, come on!

906
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:15,108
Peeta!

907
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,028
Peeta, we have to keep going!

908
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,946
I'm a mutt! I can't keep control!

909
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,531
- Yes, you can!
- Leave me! I'm a mutt!

910
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:23,450
Look at me! Look at me.

911
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,915
Stay with me.

912
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,626
Always.

913
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:33,793
Come on.

914
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:39,132
I know where we are!

915
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:41,134
I know a place. Up those stairs.

916
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:47,849
Keep going.

917
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,580
Someone's coming.

918
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,961
Shut the door, shut the door!

919
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:18,964
No, Katniss, it's okay, it's okay.

920
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:20,674
It's okay.

921
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:24,844
Tigris, do you remember me?

922
01:19:24,928 --> 01:19:27,681
I'm with Plutarch's underground.

923
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:29,182
We need your help.

924
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:30,267
Clear!

925
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:00,171
I know you. You were a stylist in the Games.

926
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,012
Until Snow decided I wasn't pretty enough anymore.

927
01:20:10,682 --> 01:20:12,017
I'm here to kill him.

928
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,147
Gale's gonna need stitches.

929
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,786
I made it up.

930
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:15,747
All of it.

931
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,502
There is no special mission from Coin.

932
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,128
There's only my plan.

933
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:28,426
Everyone that's dead is dead because of me. I lied.

934
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:31,679
We know. We all knew.

935
01:21:31,763 --> 01:21:34,974
- The soldiers from 13?
- They did, too.

936
01:21:35,058 --> 01:21:36,643
Do you really believe that Jackson thought

937
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:37,977
you had orders from Coin?

938
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:43,149
She trusted Boggs and he clearly wanted you to go on.

939
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:48,113
I never meant for this to happen.

940
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:52,033
I failed. I...

941
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:58,832
I killed them. I killed Finnick.

942
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,793
I'm sorry, Pollux.

943
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,296
I'm so sorry.

944
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:10,718
Glimmer, Marvel, Mags...

945
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:18,476
Clove, Wiress, Rue.

946
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:22,981
What do all those deaths mean?

947
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,653
They mean that our lives were never ours.

948
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:34,451
There was no real life

949
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:36,286
because we didn't have any choice.

950
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,666
Our lives belong to Snow and our deaths do, too.

951
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,421
But if you kill him, Katniss...

952
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:49,591
If you end all of this,

953
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:55,513
all those deaths, they mean something.

954
01:22:57,223 --> 01:23:01,519
Cinna, Boggs, Castor,

955
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:05,773
Jackson, Finnick.

956
01:23:08,443 --> 01:23:09,569
They chose this.

957
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:14,699
They chose you.

958
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:21,956
You should keep these clean.

959
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,541
Otherwise they'll get infected.

960
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:28,379
You should cuff me.

961
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,382
It's not safe with me yet.

962
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:34,219
I have moments when I'm here.

963
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,556
And my memories are getting better, but...

964
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,227
other times it's like I'm sleepwalking.

965
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,234
You should cuff me.

966
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:13,675
Thanks.

967
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:14,926
No problem.

968
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:23,518
I can't sleep.

969
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,603
Yeah, I haven't slept in days, either.

970
01:24:33,403 --> 01:24:36,281
I should've volunteered to take your place in the first Games.

971
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:39,075
No, you couldn't have.

972
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,162
No, she never would have forgiven you.

973
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:44,622
She needed you to be there

974
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:46,249
and take care of her family and you did.

975
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,126
She can't lose you.

976
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:52,714
She really loves you.

977
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:58,636
And the way she kissed you in the Quarter Quell.

978
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,307
She never kissed me like that.

979
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,641
Oh, just part of the show.

980
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:06,811
No. No, you won her over.

981
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:09,731
You gave up everything for her.

982
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:17,488
Well, it's not gonna be an issue much longer.

983
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,117
I doubt all three of us are gonna make it out of this.

984
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,910
And if we do, then...

985
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,331
it's her problem who to choose, right?

986
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:28,416
Yeah.

987
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:30,084
I do know that Katniss will pick

988
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:31,628
whoever she can't survive without.

989
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:39,844
Mortar shells. It's not ours.

990
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,181
Peacekeepers must be shelling' the rebels outside the city.

991
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,767
That's not outside the city.

992
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:54,859
Sun's comm' up.

993
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:57,153
There's some small-arms fire. Could be Paylor, maybe Lyme.

994
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,821
Rebels are close.

995
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:00,156
This is it.

996
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,877
To all Capitol citizens

997
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,172
more than a half mile outside the City Circle,

998
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:19,842
I am announcing a mandatory evacuation.

999
01:26:19,926 --> 01:26:21,969
Come to the mansion.

1000
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:24,722
I am promising you shelter and sanctuary.

1001
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:29,227
All refugees, come to my home.

1002
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,896
There you will be provided with food,

1003
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:36,025
medicine, safety for your children,

1004
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:37,819
and you will have my solemn oath

1005
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:41,155
to protect you until my dying breath.

1006
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:42,949
Wish he'd hurry up with that last part.

1007
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:47,453
Our enemy is not like us. They do not share our values.

1008
01:26:47,537 --> 01:26:49,205
They have never known our comfort

1009
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:51,624
and our sophistication.

1010
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:55,211
And they despise us for it. Make no mistake.

1011
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:58,214
They are not coming to liberate us.

1012
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:01,551
They are coming to destroy our way of life.

1013
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:05,930
They are coming to bury us.

1014
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:09,517
Is he still in the mansion?

1015
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,103
Peeta?

1016
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,897
Yeah. I recognize the room.

1017
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,316
Where is that?

1018
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,445
About five blocks away.

1019
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:24,949
We're right here. Off the Avenues.

1020
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:26,409
Mansion's here.

1021
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,077
What about the pods?

1022
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,079
They'll probably deactivate the pods

1023
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:32,290
around here for the residents' safety.

1024
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:36,252
That could work. I could get close enough.

1025
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:38,296
Every Peacekeeper's gonna be waiting.

1026
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:40,089
Next to our faces on every billboard.

1027
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:43,926
Snow's offering shelter to all the refugees.

1028
01:27:49,599 --> 01:27:51,017
Head straight north.

1029
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,227
There's gonna be thousands of refugees.

1030
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:55,271
Just get into that stream and don't look up.

1031
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:58,024
We got one shot.

1032
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:00,276
Let's make it count.

1033
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,322
Good luck, Katniss.

1034
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:08,451
Thank you.

1035
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:12,038
Pollux.

1036
01:28:25,635 --> 01:28:28,471
Tigris, thank you for everything you've done.

1037
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:30,807
Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

1038
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,850
I can be a good distraction. They know my face.

1039
01:28:32,934 --> 01:28:35,228
- No, I'm not losing you again.
- You'll be safer with us.

1040
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:36,646
What if Peacekeepers are searching the houses?

1041
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,439
And if he's captured...

1042
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:41,108
Then give me a nightlock pill, okay? I'm not going' back.

1043
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,180
Stay alive.

1044
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:22,358
If I see you again, it's gonna be a different world.

1045
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:33,744
Ready, Katniss?

1046
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:37,290
Let's go.

1047
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:54,181
By order of President Snow,

1048
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:57,727
all residents must proceed to the Presidential Estate.

01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,896

01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:03,441
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1051
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:06,611

By order of President Snow...

Keep moving.

1073
01:31:11,092 --> 01:31:13,552
All residents must proceed to the Presidential Estate.

1074
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:15,554
Please, continue to move forward

1075
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:18,933
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1076
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:22,311
Additional food, medicine and clothing

1077
01:31:22,395 --> 01:31:24,855
will be provided upon arrival.

1078
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:23,330
It's the rebels!

1079
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:25,041
The rebels are attacking!

1080
01:32:25,124 --> 01:32:27,418
- Rebels!
- Rebels!

1081
01:32:32,173 --> 01:32:33,883
Run! Run!

1082
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:41,891
Mama! Mama!

1083
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:43,392
Come on!

1084
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:00,659
Come on, come on!

1085
01:33:39,907 --> 01:33:41,450
Shoot me!

1086
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:43,953
Shoot me!

1087
01:34:31,959 --> 01:34:33,752
Stay calm.

1088
01:34:33,836 --> 01:34:35,963
Bring your children forward.

1089
01:34:37,006 --> 01:34:39,425
The gates will open momentarily.

1090
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:42,678
The children will be received first.

1091
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:46,974
Stay calm.

1092
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:49,268
Bring your children forward.

1093
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:53,189
The gates will open momentarily.

1094
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:56,650
The children will be received first.

1095
01:34:56,734 --> 01:34:57,985
Mom!

1096
01:34:58,068 --> 01:34:59,612
Stay calm.

1097
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:01,197
Bring your children forward.

1098
01:35:02,823 --> 01:35:05,868
The gates will open momentarily.

1099
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,370
The children will be received first.

1100
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,549
It's The Capitol!

1101
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:27,723
Gifts from The Capitol!

1102
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:36,982
Gifts!

1103
01:36:21,277 --> 01:36:22,569
Medic!

1104
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,615
Medic!

1105
01:36:28,117 --> 01:36:29,868
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1106
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,578
Medics coming in!

1107
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,289
Bring a stretcher!

1108
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,082
This way, this way!

1109
01:36:37,543 --> 01:36:38,794
Prim?

1110
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:40,671
Primrose!

1111
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:43,841
Prim!

1112
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,008
Hey. I need you to lie back.

1113
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,096
You're okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

1114
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:37,644
Fight was over after The Capitol

1115
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:39,855
dropped those bombs to defend the palace.

1116
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:43,359
The rebels walked right in.

1117
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:49,198
Don't, Katniss. The ointment's working.

1118
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,076
Everybody felt it.

1119
01:37:53,869 --> 01:37:58,540
Peacekeepers, palace guards. They had kids in there, too.

1120
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,043
It was...

1121
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:08,217
It was over after that.

1122
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:19,978
Mom?

1123
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,578
I remember the first time I brought you here.

1124
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:40,207
And here we are.

1125
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:44,962
I brought all your things.

1126
01:38:55,806 --> 01:38:57,933
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

1127
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:24,478
Sorry, ma'am. Can't let you pass.

1128
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:26,355
Let her in.

1129
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:28,565
On my authority.

1130
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:30,442
She has a right to anything behind that door.

1131
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,638
That's a nice one.

1132
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,891
The colors are lovely, of course.

1133
01:41:03,976 --> 01:41:06,103
But nothing says perfection like white.

1134
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,190
I was hoping you'd find your way here.

1135
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:14,319
There are so many things we should discuss.

1136
01:41:19,074 --> 01:41:21,702
But I have a feeling your visit will be brief,

1137
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:24,371
so first things first.

1138
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:34,423
I wanted to tell you

1139
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:37,134
how very sorry I am about your sister.

1140
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:42,806
So wasteful. So unnecessary.

1141
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:46,018
Anyone could see the game was over by that point.

1142
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:49,104
In fact, I was just about to issue an official surrender

1143
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:51,064
when they released those parachutes.

1144
01:41:51,148 --> 01:41:53,609
You released those parachutes.

1145
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,111
You really think I gave the order?

1146
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:58,238
We both know I'm not above killing children.

1147
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:01,241
But I'm not wasteful.

1148
01:42:01,742 --> 01:42:05,120
I take life for specific reasons.

1149
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,164
And there was no reason for me to destroy

1150
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:09,249
a pen full of Capitol children.

1151
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:10,876
None at all.

1152
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:21,219
I must concede, it was a masterful move on Coin's part.

1153
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,765
The idea that I was bombing

1154
01:42:24,848 --> 01:42:28,060
our own helpless children to hold back the rebels...

1155
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,980
It turned the last of my guards against me.

1156
01:42:32,064 --> 01:42:33,649
There was no resistance left

1157
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:36,193
inside The Capitol or the mansion.

1158
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:39,988
Do you know it aired live?

1159
01:42:42,616 --> 01:42:45,786
There's a particular savvy in that, isn't there?

1160
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:53,543
I'm sure she wasn't gunning for your sister, but...

1161
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,963
these things happen in war.

1162
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:03,887
My failure was in being so slow to grasp Coin's plan.

1163
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:08,934
She let The Capitol and the Districts destroy one another,

1164
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:12,813
then she stepped in to take power with 13's arsenal.

1165
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:17,192
Oh, make no mistake,

1166
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,236
she intends to take my place now.

1167
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:24,032
But I've been watching you.

1168
01:43:25,659 --> 01:43:27,536
And you watching me.

1169
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:31,623
I'm afraid we've both been played for fools.

1170
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:36,795
I don't believe you.

1171
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:41,383
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

1172
01:43:41,466 --> 01:43:45,554
I thought we'd agreed never to lie to each other.

1173
01:44:03,697 --> 01:44:04,990
President Coin asked for you.

1174
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:07,909
You never came to see me.

1175
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:13,373
I wanted to, but...

1176
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:14,624
Was it ours?

1177
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,127
The bomb.

1178
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:20,630
The delayed explosion.

1179
01:44:22,466 --> 01:44:23,717
The trap.

1180
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:27,721
To draw more people in.

1181
01:44:31,016 --> 01:44:32,058
Was that you?

1182
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:36,021
I don't know.

1183
01:44:37,272 --> 01:44:39,065
All I know is...

1184
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:42,319
that I was supposed to take care of your family.

1185
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:49,201
Now I'm sorry I couldn't.

1186
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:56,208
You can't protect anyone in an arena.

1187
01:45:13,183 --> 01:45:14,476
Goodbye, Gale.

1188
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:33,411
What's this?

1189
01:45:33,495 --> 01:45:35,789
The remaining Victors. Won't you join us?

1190
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:50,762
I have invited you all here for several reasons,

1191
01:45:50,846 --> 01:45:53,056
but first, I have an announcement.

1192
01:45:53,139 --> 01:45:56,309
I have taken the burden and the honor

1193
01:45:56,393 --> 01:45:59,729
of declaring myself Interim President of Panem.

1194
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:06,653
Interim? Exactly how long is that interim?

1195
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:09,447
We have no way of knowing for certain.

1196
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:12,534
But it's clear that people are far too emotional right now

1197
01:46:12,617 --> 01:46:14,870
to make a rational decision.

1198
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:17,455
We'll plan an election when the time is right.

1199
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:22,627
But I have called you here for a far more important vote.

1200
01:46:22,711 --> 01:46:25,005
A symbolic vote.

1201
01:46:25,088 --> 01:46:28,383
This afternoon, we will execute Snow.

1202
01:46:29,092 --> 01:46:32,679
Hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths.

1203
01:46:32,762 --> 01:46:37,767
Capitol officials, Peacekeepers, torturers, Gamemakers.

1204
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:39,895
But the danger is, once we begin,

1205
01:46:39,978 --> 01:46:43,106
the rebels will not stop calling for retribution.

1206
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:46,484
Thirst for blood is a difficult urge to satisfy.

1207
01:46:47,527 --> 01:46:51,990
So I offer an alternative plan.

1208
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:55,410
Majority of four may approve it. No one may abstain.

1209
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:58,997
The proposal is this:

1210
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:03,919
In lieu of these barbaric executions,

1211
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:08,131
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

1212
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:20,602
You wanna have another Hunger Games

1213
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:23,188
with The Capitol's children?

1214
01:47:24,105 --> 01:47:27,442
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

1215
01:47:27,692 --> 01:47:30,278
Is this Plutarch's idea?

1216
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,113
It was mine.

1217
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:36,743
It balances the need for revenge

1218
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:39,454
with the least loss of human life.

1219
01:47:40,956 --> 01:47:42,791
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1220
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,002
No, obviously not. This is crazy.

1221
01:47:46,086 --> 01:47:48,463
I think it's more than fair. Snow's got a granddaughter.

1222
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:49,881
I say yes.

1223
01:47:49,965 --> 01:47:52,550
So do I. Let them have a taste of it.

1224
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:54,010
You guys, this way of thinking

1225
01:47:54,094 --> 01:47:55,762
is what started these uprisings.

1226
01:47:55,845 --> 01:47:59,391
I vote "no." With Peeta.

1227
01:47:59,474 --> 01:48:00,809
So would Finnick, if he were here.

1228
01:48:00,892 --> 01:48:02,143
Well, he's not.

1229
01:48:02,227 --> 01:48:04,354
- Because Snow killed him.
- No.

1230
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:09,192
We need to stop viewing each other as enemies.

1231
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:12,654
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

1232
01:48:19,035 --> 01:48:21,079
I get to kill Snow.

1233
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:24,207
I expected no less of you.

1234
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:31,881
Then I vote "yes."

1235
01:48:33,842 --> 01:48:35,176
For Prim.

1236
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:39,431
Haymitch?

1237
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:52,944
I'm with the Mockingjay.

1238
01:48:54,446 --> 01:48:55,822
That carries the vote.

1239
01:48:56,990 --> 01:48:58,575
Excellent.

1240
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:01,661
We'll announce the Games tonight, after the execution.

1241
01:49:02,996 --> 01:49:07,834
Well, it's bound to be quite the show.

1242
01:49:13,048 --> 01:49:15,383
Oh, you look lovely as ever.

1243
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:18,219
Just beautiful.

1244
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:22,557
Finishing touches.

1245
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:49,352
Welcome to the new Panem.

1246
01:50:51,062 --> 01:50:54,732
Today, on the Avenue of the Tributes,

1247
01:50:55,066 --> 01:50:59,487
all of Panem, a free Panem,

1248
01:50:59,571 --> 01:51:02,490
will watch more than a mere spectacle.

1249
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:07,162
We are gathered to witness

1250
01:51:07,245 --> 01:51:10,707
an historic moment of justice.

1251
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:15,253
Today, the greatest friend to the revolution

1252
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:19,257
will fire the shot to end all wars.

1253
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,888
May her arrow signify the end of tyranny

1254
01:51:25,722 --> 01:51:29,809
and the beginning of a new era.

1255
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:33,271
Mockingjay,

1256
01:51:34,022 --> 01:51:38,276
may your aim be as true

1257
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:42,906
as your heart is pure.

1258
01:52:31,246 --> 01:52:32,247
No!

1259
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:34,290
No!

1260
01:52:34,374 --> 01:52:36,501
Kill him!

1261
01:52:40,004 --> 01:52:41,839
Kill him! Kill him now!

1262
01:52:45,927 --> 01:52:47,136
Kill him!

1263
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,169
I'll say this for you, Katniss.

1264
01:54:02,462 --> 01:54:04,005
You don't disappoint.

1265
01:54:06,549 --> 01:54:10,053
Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.

1266
01:54:10,136 --> 01:54:11,137
I don't want it.

1267
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:13,681
You never make it easy, do you?

1268
01:54:15,475 --> 01:54:18,561
Okay. I'll read it for you.

1269
01:54:19,354 --> 01:54:24,317
"Katniss, maybe the country was shocked tonight by your arrow,

1270
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,194
but once again, I was not.

1271
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:30,031
You were exactly who I believed you were.

1272
01:54:30,114 --> 01:54:32,033
I wish I could give you a proper goodbye.

1273
01:54:32,116 --> 01:54:33,785
But with both Coin and Snow dead,

1274
01:54:33,868 --> 01:54:35,995
the fate of the country will be decided tonight,

1275
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:37,997
and I can't be seen at your side.

1276
01:54:38,915 --> 01:54:43,211
Tonight, the 12 District leaders will call for a free election.

1277
01:54:43,294 --> 01:54:45,296
There's little doubt that Paylor will carry it.

1278
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,173
She's become the voice of reason.

1279
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:51,052
I'm sorry so much burden fell on you.

1280
01:54:51,135 --> 01:54:53,638
I know you'll never escape it.

1281
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:55,890
But if I had to put you through it again

1282
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:58,684
for this outcome, I would.

1283
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:04,190
The war's over. We'll enter that sweet period

1284
01:55:04,273 --> 01:55:08,027
where everyone agrees not to repeat the recent horrors.

1285
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:12,323
Of course, we're fickle, stupid beings, with poor memories

1286
01:55:12,407 --> 01:55:15,159
and a great gift for self-destruction.

1287
01:55:16,661 --> 01:55:19,705
Although, who knows? Maybe this time, we'll learn.

1288
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:24,210
I've secured you a ride out of The Capitol.

1289
01:55:24,293 --> 01:55:26,129
It's better for you to be out of sight.

1290
01:55:26,212 --> 01:55:27,338
And when the time is right,

1291
01:55:27,422 --> 01:55:29,549
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

1292
01:55:30,383 --> 01:55:32,635
The country will find its peace.

1293
01:55:32,718 --> 01:55:35,054
I hope you can find yours.

1294
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:36,931
Plutarch."

1295
01:55:39,934 --> 01:55:40,977
What now?

1296
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:45,148
Home.

1297
01:55:45,231 --> 01:55:47,442
We go home.

1298
01:55:52,363 --> 01:55:54,740
I couldn't let you go without a proper goodbye.

1299
01:56:01,122 --> 01:56:03,541
It's your job to take care of yourself now, Katniss.

1300
01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:08,963
Promise me you'll find it.

1301
01:56:10,506 --> 01:56:11,716
Find What?

1302
01:56:13,384 --> 01:56:15,553
The life of a Victor.

1303
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,891
- Goodbye, Effie.
- Goodbye, my girl.

1304
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,439
Effie, don't be a stranger.

1305
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,821
- Take care of her.
- I will.

1306
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:06,706
She's gone.

1307
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:16,215
Get out!

1308
01:58:19,343 --> 01:58:21,887
Get out! Prim is gone!

1309
01:58:21,971 --> 01:58:23,973
Prim is gone!

1310
01:58:24,098 --> 01:58:26,642
She's dead! And she's not coming back!

1311
01:58:26,726 --> 01:58:29,562
Get out! Get out!

1312
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:04,240
Peeta?

1313
02:00:08,327 --> 02:00:09,620
Hey.

1314
02:00:11,247 --> 02:00:12,915
You came home.

1315
02:00:13,999 --> 02:00:15,209
Yeah.

1316
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:24,510
I found these, uh, out by the edge of the forest.

1317
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:29,807
It's a primrose.

1318
02:00:43,529 --> 02:00:44,780
So sorry, Katniss.

1319
02:00:53,497 --> 02:00:55,750
"You'll be happy to hear that Katniss' mother

1320
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,294
has been training new medical units in The Capitol.

1321
02:00:58,377 --> 02:01:00,880
Gale has been promoted to a captain in District 2

1322
02:01:00,963 --> 02:01:03,299
to help keep order and security.

1323
02:01:03,382 --> 02:01:05,593
And I am loving every moment with my son

1324
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:08,304
who reminds me every day of his father.

1325
02:01:08,387 --> 02:01:10,139
We've all suffered so much,

1326
02:01:10,264 --> 02:01:13,184
but we owe it to their memories and to our children

1327
02:01:13,267 --> 02:01:15,811
to do our best with these lives.

1328
02:01:15,895 --> 02:01:18,898
I hope you're both finding some peace.

1329
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:20,357
Annie."

1330
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:31,368
I solemnly swear

1331
02:01:31,452 --> 02:01:35,581
to the best of my ability, to preserve, protect,

1332
02:01:35,664 --> 02:01:39,168
and uphold the rights of every citizen of Panem.

1333
02:01:39,293 --> 02:01:41,712
There's Plutarch, right in the middle of it all.

1334
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:45,049
And they say no one ever wins the Games.

1335
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:06,130
You love me.

1336
02:03:08,007 --> 02:03:09,675
Real or not real?

1337
02:03:12,136 --> 02:03:13,387
Real.

1338
02:04:09,276 --> 02:04:11,070
Did you have a nightmare?

1339
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:14,490
I have nightmares, too.

1340
02:04:21,288 --> 02:04:23,540
Someday I'll explain it to you.

1341
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:26,251
Why they came,

1342
02:04:27,795 --> 02:04:29,755
why they won't ever go away.

1343
02:04:37,471 --> 02:04:39,640
But I'll tell you how I survive it.

1344
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:44,103
I make a list in my head

1345
02:04:44,186 --> 02:04:46,939
of all the good things I've seen someone do.

1346
02:04:48,524 --> 02:04:51,193
Every little thing I can remember.

1347
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:56,448
It's like a game.

1348
02:04:56,532 --> 02:04:58,951
I do it over and over.

1349
02:05:01,328 --> 02:05:04,540
Gets a little tedious after all these years, but...

1350
02:05:06,417 --> 02:05:08,877
there are much worse games to play.

1351
