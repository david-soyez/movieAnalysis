2
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,094
Well, my dad was a farmer.

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,722
Like everybody else back then.

4
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,018
Of course, he did not start that way.

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,002
Computer says you are too tight.

6
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,946
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

7
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,117
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,037
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,418
Dad?

10
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,602
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

11
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,304
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

12
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,942
There are no such things
as ghosts,  .

13
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,310
Granddad says you can get ghosts.

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,583
Maybe that is because Granddad's a little
too close to being one himself. Back to bed.

15
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,652
Were you dreaming about the crash?

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,364
Get your   back in bed, Murph. Heh.

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,893
The wheat had died.

18
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,062
The blight came and we had to burn it.

19
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,658
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

20
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,110
But... mostly we had dust.

21
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,124
I guess I cannot describe it.
It was just constant.

22
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:06,203
Just that steady   of dirt.

23
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,341
We wore... little strips of sheet...

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,219
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

25
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,922
so that we would not breathe
so much of it.

26
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,211
Well, when we set the table,
we always set the plate upside-down.

27
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:25,555
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was upside-down.

28
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,996
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

29
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,825
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,527
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,738
Not at the table, Murph.

32
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,324
Dad, can you fix this?

33
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,445
- What the heck did you do to my lander?
- was not me.

34
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,589
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

35
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,091
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

36
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,016
- No such thing as ghosts, dumb- .
- Hey.

37
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:58,372
- I looked it up. it is called a poltergeist.
- Dad, tell her.

38
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,557
Well, it is not very scientific, Murph.

39
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,060
You said science was about admitting
what we do not know.

40
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,097
- She is got you there.
- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.

41
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,933
Coop.

42
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:14,896
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

43
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,076
do not tell me you are afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

44
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,012
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

45
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:25,532
then present your conclusions. Deal?

46
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,617
- Deal.
- All right.

47
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,622
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

48
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:37,344
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
Not grandparent.

49
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,464
Slow down, turbo!

50
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,994
- that is not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

51
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,137
Blight?

52
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:50,056
they are saying
it is the last harvest for okra.

53
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,892
Ever.

54
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,405
He should have planted corn
like the rest of us.

55
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,282
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She is single.

56
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,951
what is that supposed to mean?

57
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,246
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

58
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,408
Why do not you start
minding your own business, old man?

59
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,375
All right, Murph, give me second.

60
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,139
Third.

61
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,350
- Find a gear, dumb- .
- Grind it!

62
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,593
Shut it, Tom!

63
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,372
- what did you do, Murph?
- She did not do nothing.

64
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,974
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

65
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,689
Shut up!

66
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,062
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,191
Get the patch kit!

68
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,662
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

69
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,822
I am not always going to be here
to help you.

70
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,966
what is going on, Murph?

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,344
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that is bad?

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,798
- We did not.
- Murphy's Law?

73
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,811
Murphy's Law does not mean
that something bad will happen.

74
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,356
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

75
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,101
And that sounded just fine with us.

76
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,856
Whoa!

77
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,733
Get in.

78
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,528
Get in, let us go.

79
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,990
What about the flat tire?

80
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,285
Yeah.

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,229
it is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

82
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,888
Take the wheel, Tom.

83
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,687
Go, go, go!

84
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,940
Keep that aimed right at it.

85
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,484
Faster, Tom. I am losing it.

86
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,994
Right at it.

87
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,938
Stay on it.

88
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,507
Here we go.

89
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,336
Whoa.

90
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,052
Nice one, Tom.

91
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,893
Dad?

92
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,063
I almost got it. do not stop. do not stop!

93
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,074
- Dad!
- Tom!

94
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,989
You told me to keep driving.

95
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,286
Well, I guess that answers the old "If
I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

96
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,334
- We lost it.
- No, we did not.

97
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,681
Want to give it a whirl?

98
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,064
This way.

99
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,529
Go.

100
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,533
let us lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

101
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,539
Nicely done.

102
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,385
How long you think it is been up there?

103
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,096
Delhi Mission Control
went down, same as ours...

104
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,132
- ...ten years ago.
- Heh.

105
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,384
So for ten years?

106
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,940
- Why did it come down so low?
- I do not know.

107
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,026
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

108
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,478
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

109
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,565
Maybe some kind of signal? I do not know.

110
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,321
What are you going to do with it?

111
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,409
I am going to give it something
socially responsible to do...

112
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,619
like drive a combine.

113
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,705
cannot we just let it go?

114
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,667
It was not hurting anybody.

115
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,631
This thing needs to learn how to adapt,
Murph... like the rest of us.

116
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,231
how is this work? You guys come with?

117
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,833
I have got class. This one needs to wait.

118
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,238
- What did you do?
- they will tell you about it in there.

119
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,573
- Am I going to be mad?
- Not with me.

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,943
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

121
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,696
I got this.

122
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,920
- Little late, Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

123
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,665
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

124
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,511
No, actually, sir,
that is a surveillance drone.

125
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,464
With outstanding solar cells.
it is Indian.

126
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,216
Take a seat.

127
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,843
So...

128
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,138
we got Tomys scores back.

129
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,607
he is going to make an excellent farmer.

130
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,278
Yeah, he is got a knack for it.
What about college?

131
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,198
The university only takes a handful.
They do not have the resources to...

132
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,659
I still pay my taxes.

133
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,861
where is that money go?
there is no more armies.

134
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,697
Well, it does not go to the university.

135
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:45,070
- Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
- you are ruling my son out for college now?

136
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,915
- The kithes 15.
- Tomys score simply is not high enough.

137
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,085
what is your waistline? About what, 32?

138
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,139
- About a 33 inseam?
- I am not sure I see what you are getting at.

139
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,760
It takes two numbers to measure your  
but only one to measure my son's future?

140
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,481
Come on.
you are a well-educated man, Coop.

141
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,641
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

142
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,155
Okay, well, right now
we do not need more engineers.

143
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,793
We did not run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

144
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,413
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

145
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,991
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

146
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,796
we are a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

147
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,456
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engin...

148
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,124
Are we done here, sir?

149
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,501
No.

150
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,504
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

151
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,349
Murph is a great kid.
She is really bright.

152
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,768
But she is been having
a little trouble lately.

153
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,313
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

154
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:50,443
Yeah, it is one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

155
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,322
it is an old federal textbook. we have
replaced them with the corrected versions.

156
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,532
Corrected?

157
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,061
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

158
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,536
You do not believe we went to the moon?

159
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,631
It was a brilliant piece of propaganthe.

160
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,634
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

161
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,304
- into rockets and other useless machines.
- "Useless machines."

162
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,559
If we do not want a repeat of the excess and
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

163
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,554
we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

164
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,392
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

165
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,871
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would have been able to find...

166
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,992
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

167
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,245
Then she had have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

168
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,731
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

169
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,617
the calmer one.

170
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,770
I am sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

171
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,258
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

172
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,721
Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

173
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,590
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

174
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,811
Yeah, you know what?
there is a game tomorrow night.

175
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,105
She is going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

176
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,518
Her favorite team is playing.
there is going to be candy and sort of and...

177
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,439
I think I will take her to that.

178
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,229
how did it go?

179
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,824
I got you suspended.

180
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,575
- What?
- Cooper.

181
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,462
This is Cooper. Go.

182
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,465
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

183
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,834
Just reset the controllers.

184
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,795
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

185
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,593
One by one they have been peeling off
the fields and heading over.

186
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,528
Something's interfering
with the compass.

187
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,407
Magnetism or some such.

188
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,913
Nothing special about which book.
I have been working on it, like you said.

189
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,466
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

190
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,495
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

191
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,831
I am trying Morse.

192
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,599
Morse?

193
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,084
Yeah.

194
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,895
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

195
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,215
I just do not think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

196
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,989
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

197
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,825
- Which is?
- I do not know.

198
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,713
If the house was built
on magnetic ore...

199
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,999
we would have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

200
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,838
I hear your meeting at the school
did not go so well.

201
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,174
Heh. You heard?

202
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,970
it is like we have forgotten
who we are, Donald.

203
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,441
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

204
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,445
When I was a kid...

205
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,774
it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

206
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,444
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

207
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,992
But six billion people...
just try to imagine that.

208
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,996
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

209
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,693
This world is not so bad.

210
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,289
And Tom will do just fine.
you are the one who does not belong.

211
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,402
Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.

212
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,005
My daughter knew it,   bless her.

213
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,475
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

214
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,196
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

215
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,973
at our place in the stars.

216
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,572
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

217
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,908
Cooper, you were good at something...

218
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,745
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

219
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,072
I am sorry.

220
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:08,711
You did not expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

221
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,131
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

222
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:16,761
In April... I believe I am right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

223
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,566
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
came off the top of that canyon.

224
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,530
In my day, we had real ballplayers.
Who are these bums?

225
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,443
In my day, people were too busy
fighting over food to even play baseball.

226
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,382
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

227
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,109
School says you are going to follow
in my footsteps.

228
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,161
I think that is great.

229
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,748
- You think that is great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,134
Granddad said.

231
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,752
Granddad said?

232
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,680
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

233
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,548
I like what you do.

234
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,759
I like our farm.

235
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,020
you are going to be great at it.

236
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,801
let us get out of here.

237
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,660
All right, it is a doozy.

238
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,204
All right, gang, let us mask up.

239
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,543
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,682
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

241
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,188
Murph?

242
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,877
The ghost.

243
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,755
Grab your pillow.

244
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,382
you are sleeping in with Tom.

245
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:56,981
it is not a ghost.

246
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,821
it is gravity.

247
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,825
I am dropping Tom, then heading to town.

248
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,288
You want to clean that up
when you have finished praying to it?

249
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,899
it is not Morse, Murph. it is binary.

250
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,459
Thick is one, thin is zero.

251
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,157
Coordinates.

252
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,245
Nope.

253
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,873
Here we go.

254
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,834
Thirty-three.

255
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,838
that is it.

256
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,799
I cannot miss this!

257
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,303
Granddad will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

258
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,765
But you do not know
what you are going to find.

259
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,300
And that...

260
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,270
is why I cannot take you.

261
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,486
Murph?

262
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,075
Granddad will be home in a while.
Tell him I will call him on the radio.

263
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,499
Jesus.

264
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,385
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

265
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,712
Oh, you think this is funny?

266
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,382
You would not be here
if it was not for me.

267
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,219
Make yourself useful.

268
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,208
Hey, Murph?

269
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,978
Murph.

270
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,417
I think this is the end of the road.

271
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,464
did not you bring the bolt cutters?

272
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,883
that is my girl.

273
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,837
Step away!

274
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,090
do not shoot! I am not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

275
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,923
do not be afraid.

276
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,729
How did you find this place?

277
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,773
where is my daughter?

278
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,952
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

279
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,254
where is my daughter?

280
00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:16,573
do not make me take you down again.
Sit down!

281
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,084
Oh, you still think
you are a Marine, pal?

282
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,870
Marines do not exist anymore.

283
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:27,092
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

284
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,845
But you do not look much
like a lawnmower.

285
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,848
Think I will turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

286
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,258
No, you will not.

287
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,803
TARS, back down, please.

288
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,432
You know, you are taking a risk
using ex-military security.

289
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,695
they are old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

290
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,864
it is what the government could spare.

291
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,733
Who are you?

292
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,494
Dr. Brand.

293
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,071
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

294
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,948
What makes you think I am not?

295
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,876
was not near as cute, either.

296
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,579
Please, Dr. Brand.
I do not have any idea what this is.

297
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,882
Now I am scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

298
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,543
You give me that,
I will tell you anything you want to know.

299
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,924
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

300
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,137
Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.

301
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,523
Must have a very smart mother.

302
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,109
it is pretty clear
you do not want any visitors.

303
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,271
So why do not you just let us back up from
your fence and we will be on our way?

304
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,107
- it is not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

305
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,111
I do not know anything about you.
I do not know anything about this place.

306
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,155
Yes, you do.

307
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,953
Dad!

308
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,665
Hello, Cooper.

309
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,168
Professor Brand.

310
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:55,264
Explain to me
how you found this facility.

311
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,726
Kind of an accidid not. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

312
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,603
you are sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

313
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,307
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

314
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:09,820
Cooper, please.
Cooperate with these people.

315
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,230
Look.

316
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,815
it is kind of hard to explain.

317
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,871
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

318
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,372
What sort of anomaly?

319
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,834
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely was not scientific.

320
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,921
you are going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

321
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,373
It was gravity.

322
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:37,222
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

323
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,684
Now, I am real happy that you are excited
about gravity, bud...

324
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,663
but you are not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

325
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,555
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,818
Like, that we are getting out of here.
And I do not mean in the trunk of some car.

327
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,908
- do not you know who we are, Coop?
- No, professor, I do not.

328
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,110
You know my father, Professor Brand.

329
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,028
we are NASA.

330
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,032
- NASA?
- NASA.

331
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,159
The same NASA you flew for.

332
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,847
I heard they shut you down, sir...

333
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,018
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere onto starving people.

334
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,521
When they realized
that killing other people was...

335
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,524
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

336
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,692
- In secret.
- Why secret?

337
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,788
Because public opinion would not allow
spending on space exploration.

338
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:37,482
Not while you are struggling
to put food on the table.

339
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,068
Blight.

340
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,664
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

341
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,783
Now there is just corn.

342
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,044
And we are growing more
than we ever have.

343
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,415
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

344
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,501
the corn will die.

345
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,295
Soon.

346
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,179
we will find a way, professor.
We always have.

347
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,933
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

348
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,438
Not just ours, no. But it is our home.

349
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:22,953
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
We do not even breathe nitrogen.

350
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:28,458
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

351
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,087
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

352
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,456
And your daughter's generation...

353
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,343
will be the last to survive on Earth.

354
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,130
Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

355
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,132
Yeah. Thank you.

356
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,269
Alright...

357
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,474
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

358
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,645
we are not meant to save the world.
we are meant to leave it.

359
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,527
Rangers.

360
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:08,782
The last components of our one versatile
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

361
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,700
Our final expedition.

362
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,454
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

363
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,373
The Lazarus missions.

364
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,668
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

365
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,003
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

366
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,307
there is not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

367
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,976
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

368
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,846
That does not even qualify as futile.

369
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,849
where did you send them?

370
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,651
Cooper...

371
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:40,614
I cannot tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

372
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:44,109
- you are the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

373
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,528
This team never left the simulator.

374
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,624
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

375
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,325
Without even knowing it?

376
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,589
An hour ago, you did not even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

377
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,418
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

378
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,463
- They chose you.
- who is "they"?

379
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,347
How long would I be gone?

380
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,051
Hard to know. Years?

381
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,731
- I have got kids, professor.
- Get out there and save them.

382
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,452
who is "they"?

383
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,581
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

384
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,377
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

385
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,705
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

386
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,774
Yeah, over the Straights.

387
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,387
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

388
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,796
Exactly.

389
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,519
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

390
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,688
Out near Saturn...

391
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,973
a disturbance of space-time.

392
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,229
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

393
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,775
- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.

394
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,746
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

395
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,364
Someone placed it there.

396
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,658
"They"?

397
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,246
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

398
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:24,343
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.

399
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,429
they have put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

400
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,514
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

401
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,059
You sent probes into that?

402
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,562
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

403
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,398
The Lazarus missions.

404
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,310
Twelve possible worlds,
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

405
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:48,183
the bravest humans ever to live...
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

406
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:51,453
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

407
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,580
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,958
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

409
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,996
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

410
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,445
then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap,

411
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,717
wait to be rescued.

412
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,961
And what if the world
did not show promise?

413
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,005
Hence the bravery.

414
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,308
You do not have the resources
to visit all 12.

415
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,834
No.

416
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,271
Dato transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

417
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,485
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

418
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,478
And one system shows promise.

419
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,656
One. that is a bit
of a long shot, is not it?

420
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,027
One system with three potential worlds?

421
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,329
No long shot.

422
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,324
Okay.

423
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,568
So if we find a home...

424
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,499
- ...then what?
- that is the long shot.

425
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,045
there is a Plan A and a Plan B.

426
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,506
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

427
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,146
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

428
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,982
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

429
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,287
- Both. Plan A.
- How do you get it off the ground?

430
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,291
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

431
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,928
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

432
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,833
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

433
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,494
But you have not solved it yet.

434
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,922
that is why there is Plan B.

435
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,083
The problem is gravity.

436
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:39,102
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet.

437
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,595
This is one way.

438
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,431
Plan B: A population bomb.

439
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,520
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

440
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,697
How would you raise them?

441
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,325
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

442
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,404
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

443
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,374
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

444
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,953
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

445
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,088
This takes care of that.

446
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,749
But what about the people here?
You just...

447
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,536
You give up on them? My kids?

448
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,215
that is why Plan A is a lot more fun.

449
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,312
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

450
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,931
you are asking me to hang everything...

451
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,308
on an almost.

452
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,145
I am asking you to trust me.

453
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,899
Find us a new home.

454
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,652
And by the time you return...

455
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,905
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

456
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,450
I give you my word.

457
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,589
Go away!

458
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,484
Murph.

459
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,687
Go! If you are leaving, just go.

460
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,418
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

461
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:23,306
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

462
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,700
And it excites me? Heh.

463
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,837
No, that does not make it wrong.

464
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,666
It might. do not trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

465
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,720
The why of the thing,
that is the foundation.

466
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,205
And the foundation's solid.

467
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,180
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

468
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,723
"Next year."

469
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,061
Well, next year am not going to save us,
nor the one after that.

470
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,062
This worlthes a treasure, Donald,

471
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:58,024
but it is been telling us
to leave for a while now.

472
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,533
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

473
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,839
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

474
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,582
I will.

475
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,211
Without making promises
you do not know you can keep.

476
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,849
You have to talk to me, Murph.

477
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,445
I need to fix this before I go.

478
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,523
Then I will keep it broken
so you have to stay.

479
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,113
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

480
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,515
She said, "Now...

481
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,496
we are just here
to be memories for our kids."

482
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,129
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

483
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,636
Once you are a parent,
you are the ghost of your children's future.

484
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,432
You said ghosts did not exist.

485
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,398
that is right, Murph.

486
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,344
Murph, look at me.

487
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,491
I cannot be your ghost right now.

488
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,487
I need to exist.

489
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,832
They chose me.

490
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,503
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
you are the one who led me to them.

491
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,634
that is exactly why you cannot go.

492
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,805
I figured out the message.

493
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,401
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

494
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,936
"Stay."

495
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,189
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

496
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,575
You do not believe me.

497
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,536
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

498
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,697
Why...? you are not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

499
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,668
- No, I am coming back.
- When?

500
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,017
One for you, one for me.

501
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,387
When I am up there in hypersleep, or...

502
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,964
traveling near the speed of light, or...

503
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,651
near a black hole...

504
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,598
time's going to change for me.
it is going to run more slowly.

505
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,276
When we get back...

506
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,287
we are going to compare.

507
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,315
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

508
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,870
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

509
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,481
"What?" Imagine that!

510
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,262
Aw, Murph...

511
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,390
You have no idea when you are coming back.

512
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,929
No idea at all!

513
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,607
Murph, do not...
do not make me leave like this.

514
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,308
Come on, Murph!

515
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,445
do not make me leave like this, Murph!

516
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,778
Hey...

517
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,208
I love you. Forever. You hear me?

518
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,819
I love you forever, and I am coming back.

519
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,952
I am coming back.

520
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,447
- how did it go?
- Fine.

521
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,357
Just fine.

522
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,948
I love you, Tom.

523
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,585
- Travel safe?
- Yeah.

524
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,004
You look after our place
for me, all right?

525
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,830
All right?

526
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,234
Hey, can I use your truck
while you are gone?

527
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:31,113
You mean your truck?

528
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,041
I will make sure they bring it back.

529
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,962
Look after my kids, Donald!

530
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,861
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

531
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,581
- Dad!
- ...nine...

532
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,032
Dad!

533
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:00,402
...eight...

534
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:03,738
- seven...
- Dad!

535
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,314
...six...

536
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,210
five, main engine start, four...

537
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:11,912
three...

538
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,706
two...

539
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:16,709
one. Booster ignition and...

540
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,437
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

541
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,570
Prepare for stage one separation.

542
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,946
Stage one.

543
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,745
There is Mach 1.

544
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,417
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

545
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,589
They gave him a humor setting
so he had fit in better with his unit.

546
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,557
He thinks it relaxes us.

547
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,552
A giant sarcastic robot.

548
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,813
What a great idea!

549
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,691
I have a cue light I can use
when I am joking if you like.

550
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,900
that had probably help.

551
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,021
You can use it to find your way back to
the ship after I   you out the airlock.

552
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,075
- what is your humor setting, TARS?
- that is 100 percent.

553
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,068
let us bring it on down to 75, please.

554
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,237
Stage two separation.

555
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,175
All feeds going manual.

556
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,193
Going manual.

557
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,223
Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

558
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,466
Check.

559
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,974
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

560
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,105
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

561
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,076
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

562
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,613
- One hundred percent.
- Ex-mites.

563
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,293
it is hard leaving everything.
My kids. Your father.

564
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,263
we are going to be spending
a lot of time together.

565
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,508
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

566
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,312
Just being honest.

567
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,847
I do not think you need to be that honest.

568
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,650
Hey, TARS, what is your honesty parameter?

569
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,445
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

570
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,243
Absolute honesty is not always
the most diplomatic,

571
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:38,409
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

572
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,069
Okay.

573
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,155
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

574
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,079
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

575
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,181
Okay. Taking control.

576
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,521
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

577
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,660
it is all you, Doyle.

578
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,681
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

579
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,406
- I feel good.
- Take us home.

580
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,441
- Lock.
- Target locked.

581
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,543
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

582
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,786
Good job.

583
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,656
Door's not charging. Never mind.

584
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,139
Cooper, you should have control.

585
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,974
Control here.

586
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,019
Communication with ring module active.

587
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,027
Oh, wow.

588
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,993
that is and then she ate.

589
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,044
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

590
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,808
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

591
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,686
All right, we are all set.

592
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,646
All right, let us do it.

593
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,458
Heh.

594
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,093
Thirty percent of spin.

595
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,352
One G.

596
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,104
how is gravity treating you back there?

597
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,006
Well.

598
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,536
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

599
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,746
- Yeah.
- You all right?

600
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,031
Yeah, I just need a minute.

601
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,640
I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I am just going to get that

602
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,600
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I will just be a sec.

603
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,455
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

604
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,316
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

605
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,969
Amelia, be safe.

606
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,773
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

607
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:24,395
It looks good for your trajectory.
we have calculated two years to Saturn.

608
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,647
that is a lot of Dramamine.

609
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,817
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

610
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,353
we will be waiting for you
when you get back.

611
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,491
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

612
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,664
Do not go gentle into that good night

613
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:48,377
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day

614
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,508
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

615
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:59,179
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

616
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,391
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

617
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,353
Do not go gentle into that good night

618
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,558
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

619
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,627
- You good?
- Yeah.

620
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,046
Okay, thank you, sir.

621
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,084
Here. Pills.

622
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,255
So alone.

623
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,482
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

624
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,025
No, I mean them.

625
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,813
it is a perfect planet,
and we will not find another one like her.

626
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,651
No, it is not like looking
for a new condo.

627
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,945
The human race is going to be...

628
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:58,456
adrift...

629
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,159
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

630
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,578
We need to find that rock.

631
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:09,667
And our three prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

632
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,595
Laura Miller's planet is first.

633
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,922
- Laura started our biology program.
- COOPER:

634
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,097
- Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

635
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,884
Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist.

636
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,313
None of them had families?

637
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,201
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

638
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,913
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

639
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,040
I am hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

640
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,125
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

641
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,211
he is remarkable. he is the best of us.

642
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,757
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

643
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,509
Scientists, explorers.

644
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,796
that is what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

645
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,915
Death, but...

646
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,801
not evil.

647
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,845
You do not think nature can be evil?

648
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,089
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

649
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,684
...no, not evil.

650
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,147
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

651
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,949
Just what we take with us, then.

652
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,434
Yeah.

653
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,703
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

654
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,038
Even me?

655
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,207
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

656
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,708
There you go.

657
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,253
- do not stay up.
- I will be there in a minute.

658
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,498
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

659
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,341
Hey, TARS? let us go over
that trajectory one more time.

660
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,343
Eight months to Mars.

661
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,647
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

662
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,232
Nothing's changed on that.

663
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,517
Just let me ask you something.

664
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,690
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

665
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,231
Why are you whispering?
They cannot hear you.

666
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,661
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

667
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,246
I would not know.

668
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,316
Is that 90 percent "would not know"
or 10 percent "would not know"?

669
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,245
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

670
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,372
But not a poker face, Slick.

671
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,169
Hey, guys.

672
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,473
Dathes about to go down for the long nap.

673
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,401
So I wanted to give you an update.

674
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,422
The Earth looks amazing from here.

675
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,327
You cannot see any of the dust. Heh.

676
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,656
I really hope you guys are doing great.

677
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,598
I know you are going to get this message.
Professor Branthes assured me that...

678
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:50,157
he is going to get it to you.

679
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,830
Know that I love you.

680
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,583
- Is it him?
- I do not think so, Murph.

681
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,133
You must be Donald.

682
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,512
Hello, Murph.

683
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,265
Why are you in my dathes truck?

684
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,059
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

685
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,979
He sent you a message.

686
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,034
She is pretty upset with him for leaving.

687
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:26,321
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

688
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,075
Murph is a bright spark.

689
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,587
Maybe I should fan the flame.

690
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,340
She is already making fools
of her teachers.

691
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,576
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

692
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,497
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

693
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,910
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they will be coming up on Saturn.

694
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:33,013
...administration wants me to repeat
Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

695
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,725
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

696
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,397
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you are safe up there.

697
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,995
Sorry, Coop.

698
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:53,033
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she is as stubborn as her old man.

699
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,285
I will try again next time.

700
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,852
You all right, Rom?

701
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,891
This gets to me, Cooper. This. This.

702
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,236
Millimeters of aluminum, that is it,
and then nothing...

703
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:25,399
out there for millions of miles
will not   us in seconds.

704
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,202
You know that some of the finest...

705
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,239
solo yachtsmen in the world
do not know how to swim?

706
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:33,668
They do not know how.

707
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:35,993
And if they go overboard,
psst, they are done.

708
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,705
we are explorers, Rom.

709
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,551
This is our boat. Here.

710
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,080
This is from the... relay probe?

711
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,323
It was in orbit around the Wormhole.

712
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,836
This is the Wormhole,
and every time we would come around...

713
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,247
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

714
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,675
Oh, yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

715
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,926
Exactly.

716
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,630
So we got a pretty good idea
what we are going to find on the other side?

717
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,050
Navigationally.

718
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,463
Guys? Looks like we will be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.

719
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,887
Hey, Coop?

720
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,533
- Can we stop the spinning?
- Why?

721
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,269
Because we are close enough
to see it now?

722
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,997
All right.

723
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,281
Thanks.

724
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,964
There, that is it! that is the Wormhole!

725
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:07,593
Say it, do not spray it, Rom. it is a sphere.

726
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,955
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

727
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,051
No, it is just that all the illustrations
I have ever seen, they...

728
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,679
In the illustrations,
they are trying to show you how it works.

729
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,359
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

730
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,783
But it is too far, right?

731
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:32,067
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

732
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,952
a higher dimension.

733
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,612
Okay, so...

734
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,783
to show that,
they have turned three-dimensional space

735
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:43,962
into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

736
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,614
what is a circle in three dimensions?

737
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,126
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

738
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,044
A spherical hole.

739
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,422
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

740
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,511
I am not thanking anybody until we
get out of here in one piece, Rom.

741
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:08,445
Any trick to this, Doyle?

742
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,148
No one knows.

743
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,948
The others made it, right?

744
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,660
At least some of them.

745
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,778
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

746
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,656
To our galaxy.

747
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,618
Here we go.

748
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,704
The controls will not work here.
we are passing through the bulk.

749
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:45,325
it is space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

750
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,545
What is that?

751
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,927
- I think it is them.
- Distorting space-time.

752
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,097
do not! do not!

753
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,576
What was that?

754
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,880
The first handshake.

755
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,891
we are...

756
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,753
we are here.

757
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,126
So the lost communications came through.

758
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,170
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

759
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,915
So years of basic dato.
No real surprises.

760
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,437
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

761
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,931
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

762
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,307
Transmitter failure?

763
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,477
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

764
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,396
But Miller's still
looks good though, right?

765
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,890
- Because she is coming up fast.
- DOYLE:

766
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,351
With one complication.

767
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,737
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

768
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,574
- Gargantua?
- it is what we are calling the black hole.

769
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,034
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

770
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,413
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

771
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,582
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

772
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,035
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

773
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,591
Look, I could swing around
that neutron star to decelerate.

774
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,434
No, it is not that. it is time.

775
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:04,339
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

776
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,099
How bad?

777
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,844
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

778
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,889
seven years back on Earth.

779
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,808
Jesus.

780
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,810
Well, that is relativity, folks.

781
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,655
Well, we cannot just drop down
there without...

782
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,699
Cooper, we have a mission.

783
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,452
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

784
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,788
to find a planet that can habitate the
people that are living on Earth right now.

785
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,791
You cannot just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger than that.

786
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,970
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

787
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:39,624
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

788
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:44,587
No. It does not.
that is why there is a Plan B.

789
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:49,449
Okay. Cooper's right.
We need to think of time as a resource,

790
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:52,011
just like oxygen and food.
Going down it is going to cost us.

791
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,957
All right, look.

792
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,278
Dr. Mann's dato is promising,
but it is going to take months to get there.

793
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,656
And Edmunds', it is even further.

794
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,563
Miller has not sent much,
but what she has is very promising.

795
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:06,993
it is water, it is organics...

796
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,329
- You do not find that every day.
- No, you do not.

797
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,831
And just think about the resources,
including time...

798
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,534
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

799
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,020
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

800
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,424
...how far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

801
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,260
Just back from the cusp.

802
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,388
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

803
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,381
- Right.
- Okay.

804
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,060
here is Gargantua.
here is Miller's planet.

805
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,397
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

806
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,441
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

807
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,709
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

808
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:45,365
parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?

809
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,326
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

810
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,204
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
we are in, we are out.

811
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,707
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

812
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,509
- Thatoll work.
- that is good.

813
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:58,136
there is no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

814
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:01,098
So, TARS,
you should definitely stay here.

815
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:03,717
CASE, you are with me.
Anyone else can stay.

816
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,935
If we are talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

817
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:10,598
Observations from the Wormhole,
that is gold to Professor Brand.

818
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,434
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

819
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,804
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,

820
01:05:15,104 --> 01:05:17,355
but make sure we stay in
range of Miller's planet.

821
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,066
- You got it?
- I would not leave you behind...

822
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,309
Dr. Brand.

823
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,607
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

824
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:32,070
- You do not say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

825
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,322
Detach.

826
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,582
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- it is unbelievable.

827
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,221
A literal heart of darkness.

828
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,770
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

829
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,722
the singularity, yeah,
we would solve gravity.

830
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,401
- And we cannot get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

831
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,903
Not even light.

832
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,606
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- there is Miller's planet.

833
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,210
Goodbye, Ranger.

834
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,675
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

835
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,128
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

836
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,890
I am going to use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

837
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,266
Air brake?

838
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,978
- We want to get down fast, do not we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

839
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,181
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

840
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,500
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

841
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,003
The only time I went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

842
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:07,006
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

843
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,375
- Cooper, it is too   fast!
- I got this.

844
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:18,217
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

845
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:23,589
Here we go.

846
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,977
it is just water!

847
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,980
The stuff of life.

848
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,824
Twelve hundred meters.

849
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:35,034
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

850
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,829
- Can you maneuver?
- I will need to shave some speed.

851
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,657
I am going to spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

852
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,118
Seven hundred.

853
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,247
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

854
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,252
Five hundred meters.

855
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,763
Fire!

856
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,654
- Very graceful.
- No.

857
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,365
But very efficient.

858
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,003
What are you waiting for? let us go!

859
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,122
Go, go, go!

860
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:32,792
Seven years per hour here.
let us make it count!

861
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,153
This way.

862
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,741
About 200 meters.

863
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,277
The gravity's punishing.

864
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,930
Been floating through space too long?

865
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,307
110% Earth gravity.

866
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,709
Come on. Come on.

867
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,973
- there is nothing here.
- Should be right here.

868
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:34,095
If the signal's
coming from here, then...

869
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,097
Her beacon.

870
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,873
Wreckage.

871
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,708
where is the rest?

872
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,710
Towards the mountains!

873
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,382
Those are not mountains.

874
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,385
they are waves.

875
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,393
Oh,  . Oh,  . Oh,  .

876
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,896
That one's moving away from us.

877
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,071
We need the recorder.

878
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,467
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

879
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,012
we are not leaving without her dato.

880
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,390
Get back here now! We do not have time!

881
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,051
The second wave is coming!
we are in the middle of a swell.

882
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,729
No, I got it.

883
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,931
Get your   back to the Ranger now!

884
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,980
Brand, get back here now!

885
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,150
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I cannot make it.

886
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,945
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

887
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,743
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

888
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,162
Go, go! Go!

889
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,584
- I am not going to make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

890
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,718
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

891
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,005
Come on!

892
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,976
Get to the hatch!

893
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,024
Go, go! Go!

894
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,655
 .

895
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,991
Manually overriding inside hatch!

896
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,662
Cooper! Wait!

897
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,673
The engines are flooded!
I am going to have to shut her down.

898
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,458
Holy  .

899
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,214
Hang on!

900
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:23,290
- CASE, what is the problem?
- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

901
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,593
  it!

902
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:30,431
- I told you to leave me! Why did not you?
- And I told you to get your   back here!

903
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:35,302
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

904
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,440
I was trying to do the right thing!

905
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,600
Can you tell that to Doyle?

906
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:46,063
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

907
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:51,545
The stuff of life?
what is this going to cost us, Brand?

908
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,372
A lot. Decades.

909
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,955
What happened to Miller?

910
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:09,220
Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

911
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,256
how is the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

912
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,709
Because of the time slippage.

913
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:21,140
On this planetos time,
she just landed hours ago.

914
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,402
She probably just died minutes ago.

915
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,647
The dato Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

916
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,192
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

917
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,998
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

918
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,418
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

919
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,336
Well, not far enough!

920
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,040
And now we are stuck here till there
will not be anyone left on Earth to save.

921
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,754
I am counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

922
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,352
Is there any possibility...

923
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,148
I do not know, some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

924
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,016
Gain back the years?

925
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,152
do not shake your head at me.

926
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,321
Time is relative, okay?

927
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,565
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but...

928
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,243
it cannot run backwards. It just cannot.

929
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,864
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

930
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,943
Okay.

931
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:28,549
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

932
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,551
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

933
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,920
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

934
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,090
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

935
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,553
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

936
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,306
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

937
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,975
To them...

938
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,529
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

939
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,732
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it is not, okay?

940
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:58,236
Look, Cooper, I   up. I am sorry.

941
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:02,658
- But you knew about relativity.
- Oh.

942
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,936
Brand...

943
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,535
my daughter was 10 years old.

944
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,754
I could not teach her
Einsteings theories before I left.

945
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,008
could not you have told her
you were going to save the world?

946
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,034
No.

947
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:26,673
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

948
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,145
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

949
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:36,241
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

950
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:39,778
Cooper?

951
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,960
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

952
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,245
We do not have it. Helmets on!

953
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,926
Brand, co-pilot, you are up.

954
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,595
CASE,   the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

955
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,505
- we are going to spark it.
- Roger that.

956
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,132
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

957
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,264
Engines up!

958
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,628
Hello, Rom.

959
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,955
I have waited years.

960
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,275
How...? How many years?

961
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,438
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

962
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,548
four months, eight days.

963
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,337
Doyle?

964
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,254
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

965
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,032
Reality's different.

966
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,744
And Miller?

967
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,830
there is nothing here for us.

968
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:17,084
Why did not you sleep?

969
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,901
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.

970
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:22,131
But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

971
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,634
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

972
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,305
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

973
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,108
but I could not send anything
to your father.

974
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,527
we have been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

975
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,012
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

976
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

977
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,029
we have got years of messages stored.

978
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,455
Cooper.

979
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,858
Messages span 23 years.

980
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,370
Play it from the beginning.

981
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,325
Hey, Dad.

982
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,578
Checking in. Saying hi.

983
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,124
Finished second in school.

984
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,020
Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

985
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,257
Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.

986
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:16,693
Granddad attended the ceremony.

987
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,022
Oh.

988
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,908
I met another girl, Dad.

989
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,893
I...

990
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,646
I really think this is the one.

991
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,925
Name's Lois. that is her right there.

992
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,772
Murphy stole Granddad's car.

993
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:40,008
She crashed it. She is okay, though.

994
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,760
Hey, Dad.

995
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,912
Look at this!

996
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,248
you are a granddad.

997
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,334
His name's Jesse.

998
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,857
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says... maybe next time.

999
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:59,478
Donald says he is already earned the
"great" part, so we just leave it at that.

1000
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,441
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1001
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:09,071
Say "Bye-bye, Granddad."
Bye-bye, Granddad. Okay.

1002
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,990
Sorry it is been a while.

1003
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,910
Just...

1004
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,922
what with Jesse and all.

1005
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,664
Granddad died last week.

1006
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,368
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

1007
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,428
Jesse.

1008
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:37,290
Which is where we would have buried you
if you would ever...

1009
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,643
come back.

1010
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,096
Murph was there at the funeral.

1011
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,375
We do not see her that much,
but she came for that.

1012
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,405
You are not listening to this,
I know that.

1013
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,786
All these messages are just, like...

1014
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:03,024
drifting out there in the darkness.

1015
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,044
Lois says that...

1016
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,765
I have to let you go.

1017
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,800
And...

1018
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,885
So...

1019
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,825
I guess I am letting you go.

1020
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,753
I do not know where you are, Dad...

1021
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,807
but I hope that you are at peace.

1022
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,685
Goodbye.

1023
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,633
Hey, Dad.

1024
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,304
Hey, Murph.

1025
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,822
You son of a  .

1026
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,603
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1027
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,339
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1028
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,569
And then when you went quiet, it...

1029
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:10,233
seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.

1030
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,857
But today's my birthday.

1031
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:23,897
And it is a special one,
because you told me...

1032
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:32,164
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1033
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,960
And today I am the age you were
when you left.

1034
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,815
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1035
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:00,617
I did not mean to intrude. it is just that
I have never seen you in here before.

1036
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,412
I have never been in here before.

1037
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:10,427
I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps.

1038
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,514
- I am glad you have started.
- I have not. I...

1039
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,216
I just had something
I needed to get out.

1040
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,936
- I know they are still out there.
- I know.

1041
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,315
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1042
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,933
I know, professor.

1043
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,478
I am not sure what I am more afraid of.

1044
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,382
Them never coming back or...

1045
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,370
coming back to find we have failed.

1046
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,988
Then let us succeed.

1047
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,473
So...

1048
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,920
back to the fourth iteration.
let us run it through some new fields.

1049
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,424
With respect, professor,
we have tried that hundreds of times.

1050
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,694
It only has to work once, Murph.

1051
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:59,435
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1052
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,603
we have done well for the world here...

1053
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:06,525
whether or not we   the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1054
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,603
- do not be morbid, professor.
- I am not afraid of death.

1055
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,589
I am an old physicist.

1056
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,108
I am afraid of time.

1057
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,450
Time.

1058
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,162
you are afraid of time.

1059
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,717
we have been trying
to solve the equation...

1060
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,386
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1061
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,263
- And?
- And that means...

1062
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,893
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1063
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,312
it is recursive. it is nonsensical.

1064
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:47,274
Are you calling my life's work...
nonsense, Murph?

1065
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,285
No, I am saying
that you have been trying to...

1066
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:53,680
finish it with one arm...
No, with both arms tied behind your back.

1067
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,867
And I do not understand why.

1068
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,662
I am an old man, Murph.

1069
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,874
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1070
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,401
I want to talk to my daughter.

1071
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,797
Stepping out into the universe...

1072
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,793
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1073
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:20,224
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1074
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:25,854
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1075
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:31,617
Do not go gentle into that good night

1076
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,739
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1077
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,734
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1078
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:42,571
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1079
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,606
we have to choose.

1080
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,942
But how?

1081
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,653
they are both promising.

1082
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,467
Edmunds' dato is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1083
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,787
we have no reason to suspect
Edmunds's dato would have soured.

1084
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,974
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1085
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:05,543
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1086
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,754
And...

1087
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,482
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1088
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:14,219
- Why?
- Gargantua, that is why.

1089
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:19,157
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1090
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:23,979
but no life. Sterile.
we will find the same thing on Mann's.

1091
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,956
Because of the black hole?

1092
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,167
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1093
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,670
Accidid not is the first building block
of evolution.

1094
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,673
But when you are orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1095
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,322
It sucks in asteroids and comets,

1096
01:26:37,422 --> 01:26:39,344
other events which would
otherwise reach you.

1097
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,579
We need to go further afield.

1098
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,541
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1099
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,185
was the best of us.

1100
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:50,755
he is remarkable.
we are only here because of him.

1101
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,899
And yet... Yet here he is.

1102
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:57,285
he is on the ground, and he is sending
a very unambiguous message,

1103
01:26:57,385 --> 01:26:59,906
telling us to come to his planet.

1104
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:04,936
Granted, but Edmunds' dato
is more promising.

1105
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,204
We should vote.

1106
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,773
Well, if we vote,
there is something you should know.

1107
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:12,777
Brand? He has a right to know.

1108
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,796
That has nothing to do with it.

1109
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:18,008
- What does?
- She is in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1110
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:21,152
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1111
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,833
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1112
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,732
But maybe we have spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1113
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,317
you are a scientist, Brand.

1114
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,260
So listen to me...

1115
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:42,807
when I say that love
is not something we invented. it is...

1116
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:46,144
observable, powerful.

1117
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,606
It has to mean something.

1118
01:27:49,706 --> 01:27:54,052
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1119
01:27:54,152 --> 01:27:57,956
We love people who have died.
where is the social utility in that?

1120
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,508
None.

1121
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,553
Maybe it means something more,
something we cannot...

1122
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,764
yet understand.

1123
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,626
Maybe it is some evidence, some...

1124
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,815
artifact of a higher dimension
that we cannot consciously perceive.

1125
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,778
I am drawn across the universe
to someone I have not seen in a decade...

1126
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,948
who I know is probably dead.

1127
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,451
Love is the one thing
we are capable of perceiving...

1128
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,687
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1129
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:35,860
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we cannot understand it yet.

1130
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,534
All right, Cooper...

1131
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,703
yes...

1132
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:50,108
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1133
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,710
That does not mean I am wrong.

1134
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,588
Honestly, Amelia...

1135
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,350
it might.

1136
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,059
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1137
01:29:24,851 --> 01:29:28,121
we will lose about a third again.
But next year...

1138
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:33,051
Next year I am going to work Nelson's farm
and we will make it up.

1139
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,920
What happened to Nelson?

1140
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,820
Murph, have you eaten enough?
Would you like some more souffle?

1141
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,599
Oh, no. I am full, thanks.
It was delicious.

1142
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,476
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1143
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:56,124
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. it is ready.

1144
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,667
I need to get back.

1145
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,578
My sewing machine is in there,
but there is plenty...

1146
01:29:59,678 --> 01:30:02,071
I need to...

1147
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,692
Too many memories.

1148
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,713
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1149
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,555
The dust.

1150
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,401
Lois, I have a friend who...

1151
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:25,637
could look at his lungs.

1152
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,258
- Amelia, I am sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1153
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:49,886
Unless you are punishing me
for   up on Miller's planet.

1154
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,538
No, this was not a personal decision.

1155
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,185
If you are wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1156
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,480
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1157
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,651
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we will have
to decide whether to return home...

1158
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,112
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1159
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:11,116
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1160
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,452
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1161
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,488
and the future of the human race.

1162
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,699
I trust you will be as objective then.

1163
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,466
he is been asking for you
since he came to.

1164
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,293
We were trying to reach you.

1165
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,500
Murph.

1166
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,003
I am here, professor.

1167
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,781
I let you all down.

1168
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:46,718
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1169
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,113
I will finish what you started.

1170
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,724
Good, good Murph.

1171
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,312
You had faith...

1172
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,814
all those...

1173
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,567
all those years.

1174
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,253
I...

1175
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,156
I asked you to have faith.

1176
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,702
I wanted you to believe...

1177
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:16,080
that your father...

1178
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,685
would come back.

1179
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,078
I do, professor.

1180
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:27,959
- Forgive me, Murph.
- there is nothing to forgive.

1181
01:32:31,028 --> 01:32:34,390
I... I lied, Murph.

1182
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,561
I lied to you.

1183
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,912
There was no need for him to...

1184
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,199
To come back.

1185
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,121
There is no way to help us.

1186
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,457
But Plan A...

1187
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:03,127
All this. All these people.

1188
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,048
And the equation.

1189
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,603
Did my father know?

1190
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,508
Did he leave me?

1191
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,313
Do...

1192
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,816
not...

1193
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,026
go...

1194
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,021
gentle...

1195
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,990
No.

1196
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,943
No!

1197
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,596
You cannot leave.

1198
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,248
You... No.

1199
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:46,003
Dr. Brand, I am sorry to tell you
that your father died today. He had no pain.

1200
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:48,356
He was at peace.

1201
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:51,008
I am very sorry for your loss.

1202
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,073
Brand, did you know?

1203
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,360
He told you, right?

1204
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,814
You knew.

1205
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,326
This was all a sham.

1206
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,591
You left us here.

1207
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:27,044
To suffocate.

1208
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,548
To starve.

1209
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,043
Frozen cloud.

1210
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,641
it is okay. it is okay.

1211
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,982
it is okay.

1212
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,406
Pray you never learn...

1213
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,911
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1214
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,605
I had not a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1215
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,341
after so long, I had none.

1216
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:04,845
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1217
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,559
The last time I went to sleep,
I did not even set a waking date.

1218
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:16,857
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

1219
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,850
Lazarus.

1220
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:24,240
- What about the others?
- I am afraid you are it, sir.

1221
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,368
So far, surely.

1222
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:32,757
No, our present situation is that there is
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1223
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:38,921
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1224
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,390
Tell us about your world.

1225
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,612
Our world, we hope.

1226
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,744
Our world... is cold...

1227
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,637
stark...

1228
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,149
but undeniably beautiful.

1229
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,654
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1230
01:39:07,558 --> 01:39:09,177
The nights are...

1231
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:12,112
67 far colder hours.

1232
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:21,856
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1233
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,193
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1234
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,113
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

1235
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,868
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1236
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,660
the chlorine dissipates.

1237
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:39,874
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1238
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:44,245
To organics. Possibly even to life.

1239
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,198
We might be sharing this world.

1240
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,267
These readings are from the surface?

1241
01:39:49,367 --> 01:39:52,970
Over the years,
I have dropped various probes.

1242
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,557
- How far have you explored?
- I have mounted several major expeditions.

1243
01:39:56,657 --> 01:40:00,778
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1244
01:40:00,878 --> 01:40:03,606
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1245
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:07,360
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1246
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,656
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1247
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,991
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1248
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,161
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1249
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,230
Would you like me to look at him?

1250
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,666
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1251
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,337
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1252
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:29,198
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1253
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,596
Dr. Brand, I am sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1254
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,331
He had no pain.

1255
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,761
He was at peace.

1256
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,682
I am sorry for your loss.

1257
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:58,102
Is that Murph?

1258
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,038
She is... She is grown.

1259
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,223
Brand, did you know?

1260
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:06,060
He told you, right?

1261
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,197
You knew.

1262
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,250
This was all a sham.

1263
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,361
You left us here.

1264
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,790
To suffocate.

1265
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,252
To starve.

1266
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,073
Did my father know too?

1267
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,219
Dad?

1268
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,890
I just want to know...

1269
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,126
if you left me here to die.

1270
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,814
I just have to know.

1271
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,738
Cooper, my...

1272
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,133
My father dedicated...

1273
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:59,738
his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she is talking about.

1274
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,616
I do.

1275
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:10,215
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1276
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,635
No.

1277
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,517
But he is been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1278
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:24,438
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1279
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,666
Then why would not he use it?

1280
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,795
The equation could not reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1281
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,880
More? More what?

1282
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,050
More dato.
You need to see into a black hole.

1283
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,302
The laws of nature prohibit
a   singularity.

1284
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,204
Romilly, is that true?

1285
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,976
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1286
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:49,913
The gravity's so strong, it is always
hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.

1287
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,984
that is why we call it a black hole.

1288
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,804
Okay, but if we see
beyond the horizon...

1289
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,656
We cannot, Coop.

1290
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,492
There are some things
that are not meant to be known.

1291
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:05,705
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1292
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:09,441
- Plan B. A colony.
- Why not tell people?

1293
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,879
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1294
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,175
to get people to work together to save
the species instead of themselves.

1295
01:43:18,475 --> 01:43:20,720
- Or their children.
-  .

1296
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,681
You never would have come here
unless you believed you would save them.

1297
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,659
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1298
01:43:26,759 --> 01:43:30,651
We can care deeply,
selflessly about those we know,

1299
01:43:30,751 --> 01:43:33,357
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

1300
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,467
But the lie.

1301
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:41,081
That monstrous lie?

1302
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:45,352
Unforgivable. And he knew that.

1303
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,207
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1304
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,027
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1305
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,124
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are going to die!

1306
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,752
Because in his   arrogance...

1307
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,255
he declared their case hopeless.

1308
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:08,392
I am sorry, Cooper...
their case is hopeless.

1309
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,919
No. No.

1310
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,847
We are the future.

1311
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,635
Cooper, what can I do?

1312
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,482
Let me go home.

1313
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,985
you are absolutely positive?

1314
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,113
His solution was correct.
he had had it for years.

1315
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,408
- it is worthless?
- it is half the answer.

1316
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,370
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1317
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,589
Out there? A black hole.

1318
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,825
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1319
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,828
I am not sure you can.

1320
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:49,416
 , they just pack up and leave.

1321
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,920
What are they hoping to find?

1322
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,546
Survival.

1323
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,430
  it.

1324
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,945
Murph, do not...?
do not people have a right to know?

1325
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:14,625
Panic will not help. We just
have to keep working, same as ever.

1326
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,129
But is not that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1327
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:21,582
Brand gave up on us.
I am still trying to solve this.

1328
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:23,692
So...

1329
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,579
do you have an idea?

1330
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,622
A feeling.

1331
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,044
I told you about my ghost.

1332
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:38,049
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1333
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:40,217
because I was scared of it.

1334
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,712
But I was never scared of it.

1335
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,893
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1336
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,981
It felt like a person.

1337
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:58,193
It was trying to tell me something.

1338
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,958
If there is an answer here on Earth,
it is back there...

1339
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:08,829
somehow, in that room.
So I have to find it.

1340
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:14,001
we are running out of time.

1341
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,688
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1342
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,024
No, they can stay.
I will be sleeping anyway.

1343
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,776
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1344
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,944
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1345
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,897
- Yeah, what is that?
- Have one last   at the black hole.

1346
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,126
I am going home, Rom.

1347
01:46:30,226 --> 01:46:33,979
Yeah, I know.
This is not going to cost you any time.

1348
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,465
there is a chance for the people on Earth.

1349
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,127
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1350
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,173
- it is what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1351
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,802
they are hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1352
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,223
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1353
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:57,061
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1354
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,314
So, what is to say
there is not some way that the probe...

1355
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,400
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum dato?

1356
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,821
If he is equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1357
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:10,015
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1358
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,309
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1359
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,829
I have already told him what to look for.

1360
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,706
I would need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1361
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,208
you would do this for us?

1362
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,529
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1363
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:27,616
- Your cue lightos broken.
- I am not joking.

1364
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,264
I am going to need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1365
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,766
I do not want to disturb
his archival functions.

1366
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,601
I will supervise.

1367
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,811
All right.

1368
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:41,346
Dr. Mann, we need to
find three secure sites.

1369
01:47:41,746 --> 01:47:43,649
One for Branthes lab, two for habitat.

1370
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,277
Once those modules have landed,
you do not want to move them.

1371
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,988
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I do not think...

1372
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,866
these conditions are going to hold.
I think we should wait.

1373
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,869
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1374
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:58,105
I would really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1375
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:03,110
Well, these squalls do usually   over.

1376
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,420
Okay, then.

1377
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,797
- you will need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1378
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,740
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1379
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,367
Follow me.

1380
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:14,505
- TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
- Roger that, Cooper.

1381
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:24,047
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1382
01:48:25,482 --> 01:48:28,569
But I would be remiss
if I did not at least mention...

1383
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:32,940
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1384
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:39,029
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1385
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:41,607
Safety first, Cooper.

1386
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:45,636
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I am honored to be a part of this.

1387
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:51,242
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1388
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,693
I am going home.

1389
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:03,861
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1390
01:49:03,961 --> 01:49:09,384
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1391
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:13,388
That emotion is at the foundation...

1392
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,900
of what makes us human.
it is not to be taken lightly.

1393
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,494
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1394
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:40,165
Mom lets me play in here.

1395
01:49:41,584 --> 01:49:43,335
I do not touch your stuff.

1396
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,951
Just take this gently.

1397
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:24,459
You know why we could not just send machines
on these missions, do not you, Cooper?

1398
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:29,514
A machine does not improvise well
because you cannot program a fear of death.

1399
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:34,609
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

1400
01:50:34,723 --> 01:50:36,638
Take you, for example.

1401
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,682
A father...

1402
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:42,185
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1403
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:48,024
What does research tell us is the last thing
you are going to see before you die?

1404
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:52,129
Your children. Their faces.

1405
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:56,992
At the moment of death, your minthes
going to push a little bit harder to survive.

1406
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,943
For them.

1407
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,871
Deep breath.

1408
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:06,810
Hey. I bet you are Coop.
Why do not you have a seat here for me?

1409
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,546
it is bad. They can not stay here.

1410
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:11,348
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1411
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,116
TARS, what is taking so long?

1412
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:24,161
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1413
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:26,004
I do not understand.

1414
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:34,154
it is funny.

1415
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,866
When I left Earth...

1416
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,952
I thought I was prepared to die.

1417
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:44,531
The truth is...

1418
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:51,546
I never really considered the possibility
that my planet was not the one.

1419
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,360
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1420
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,002
let us go.

1421
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,864
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

1422
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,078
What is this?

1423
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:16,431
What are you doing?

1424
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:19,466
I am sorry!
I cannot let you leave with that ship.

1425
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,136
we are going to need it
to complete the mission...

1426
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:25,848
once the others realize
what this place is not.

1427
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:30,269
We can not survive here.
I am sorry! I am sorry!

1428
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:43,157
- They cannot stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1429
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:46,869
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1430
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:50,230
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She is going home.

1431
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,416
Dad did not raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

1432
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:56,703
Dad did not raise me, Granddad did.
And he is buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1433
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,156
You faked all the dato?

1434
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:02,951
Yeah.

1435
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,432
there is no surface?

1436
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:10,000
No.

1437
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,728
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1438
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:18,133
but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1439
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:22,554
And I resisted
the temptation for years...

1440
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:25,199
but I knew that...

1441
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:28,327
if I just pressed that button, then...

1442
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,529
somebody would come and save me.

1443
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,073
You   coward.

1444
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:34,950
Yes.

1445
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:41,615
Yes.

1446
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:44,576
Yes.

1447
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:46,637
Yes.

1448
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:02,727
Listen, if you are not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1449
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:07,574
And we go live underground with you?
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1450
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:11,648
Dathes not coming back.
He never was coming back. it is up to me.

1451
01:54:11,748 --> 01:54:14,661
you are going to save everybody?
Because Dad could not do it.

1452
01:54:14,761 --> 01:54:19,069
Dad did not even try!
Dad just abandoned us!

1453
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,613
He left us here to die.

1454
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,790
Nobody's going with you.

1455
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:30,413
You going to wait for your next kid to die?

1456
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,709
Get out.

1457
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,920
And do not come back.

1458
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,635
You can keep my stuff.

1459
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:55,939
Stop it!

1460
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,527
No. No!

1461
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,489
Dr. Mann, there is a 50-50 chance
you are going to   yourself!

1462
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:07,092
Those are the best odds
I have had in years.

1463
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,597
do not judge me, Cooper.

1464
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:34,386
You were never tested like I was.
Few men have been.

1465
01:55:42,727 --> 01:55:44,195
You tried your best, Murph.

1466
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:55,703
you are feeling it, are not you?

1467
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,585
The survival instinct.

1468
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:03,640
that is what drove me. it is what drives
all of us. And it is what is going to save us.

1469
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:08,344
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1470
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:16,995
I am sorry, I cannot watch you
go through this. I am sorry.

1471
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:20,064
I thought I could, but I cannot.

1472
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:23,210
I am here. I am here for you.

1473
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,653
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1474
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,981
I am right here.

1475
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:30,950
you are not alone.

1476
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:42,070
Do you see your children?

1477
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:46,758
it is okay.

1478
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,469
they are right there with you.

1479
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:55,934
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1480
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:58,269
Do you remember?

1481
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:03,616
Do not go gentle into that good night

1482
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:09,781
Old age should burn and rave
At close of day

1483
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,743
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

1484
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,828
Brand! Help!

1485
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:42,188
- Help!
- Cooper?

1486
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:50,088
CASE!

1487
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,781
No air.

1488
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,825
Ammonia.

1489
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,179
Cooper. Cooper, we are coming! CASE!

1490
01:57:57,279 --> 01:57:59,264
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1491
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,749
And away!

1492
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,280
Cooper, we are coming.
Hang in there. do not talk.

1493
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,974
Try to breathe as little as possible.
we are almost there.

1494
01:58:21,444 --> 01:58:27,066
there is a security lockout, sir.
It requires a person to access function.

1495
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:33,615
it is all yours, sir.

1496
01:58:41,631 --> 01:58:43,391
Try not to breathe.

1497
01:58:43,992 --> 01:58:48,021
we are coming. we are coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!

1498
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:51,132
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1499
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,347
Hang in there. Come on.

1500
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:07,148
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

1501
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:28,970
Cooper! Cooper! I am here!

1502
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:54,304
This dato makes no sense.

1503
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:04,014
I am sorry.

1504
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:07,000
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1505
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,551
Go. Go.

1506
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,653
Romilly.

1507
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:20,030
Romilly!

1508
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:22,849
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

1509
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,235
Step back, professor! Step back!

1510
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:35,945
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1511
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:40,483
Keep watch!

1512
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:42,377
Lois?

1513
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:45,580
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1514
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:50,376
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1515
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:54,064
Romilly?

1516
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:57,050
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
there is been an explosion.

1517
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,469
Dr. Mann's compound.

1518
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:29,123
TARS, TARS, 10 of the clock!

1519
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,465
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1520
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,970
Romilly did not survive.

1521
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,615
I could not save him.

1522
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:47,242
- TARS is in.
- I will take her now.

1523
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:50,286
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- he is pushing into orbit!

1524
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:53,689
If he takes control
of that ship, we are dead.

1525
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:57,860
- he had maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1526
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,365
I will meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1527
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:11,685
Come on! Give me your bag.

1528
02:02:11,985 --> 02:02:14,418
Get in the backseat.
Get in the backseat now!

1529
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:21,968
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1530
02:02:22,293 --> 02:02:24,446
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1531
02:02:24,746 --> 02:02:26,823
He does not know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1532
02:02:26,923 --> 02:02:29,725
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1533
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:31,745
Nice.

1534
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:35,064
- what is your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1535
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:42,005
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1536
02:02:42,105 --> 02:02:43,214
Please res...

1537
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:45,026
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1538
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:48,095
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

1539
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:50,139
Override.

1540
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,516
Unauthorized.

1541
02:03:56,346 --> 02:04:00,575
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1542
02:04:44,268 --> 02:04:46,537
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1543
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:12,614
Imperfect contact.

1544
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:15,057
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1545
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:25,401
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1546
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:28,254
Dr. Mann, do not...

1547
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:52,970
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1548
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:04,958
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1549
02:06:05,058 --> 02:06:07,001
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1550
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:10,237
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1551
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:38,432
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1552
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,708
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we have got, CASE!

1553
02:06:46,808 --> 02:06:48,584
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1554
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:50,753
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

1555
02:06:50,853 --> 02:06:53,006
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1556
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,448
Dr. Mann...

1557
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,679
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1558
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:01,122
Brand?

1559
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:03,766
I do not know what he said to you...

1560
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:06,836
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1561
02:07:06,994 --> 02:07:09,338
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1562
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,310
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1563
02:07:15,002 --> 02:07:17,304
This is not about my life.

1564
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:21,183
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1565
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:23,085
There is a moment...

1566
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:30,660
It is not sa...

1567
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,002
Oh, my  .

1568
02:07:58,212 --> 02:08:02,475
- there is no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1569
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,940
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1570
02:08:14,228 --> 02:08:17,131
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1571
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:19,759
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1572
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:23,379
- it is not possible.
- No... it is necessary.

1573
02:08:34,916 --> 02:08:37,384
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1574
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,474
She is got no heat shield.

1575
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:48,154
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1576
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,949
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1577
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:03,719
CASE, if I black out,
you take the stick.

1578
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:06,580
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1579
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:16,399
- Endurance is starting to heat.
- Twenty feet out.

1580
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,068
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1581
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:21,237
Ten feet out.

1582
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:23,906
Cooper, we are lined up.

1583
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:25,691
Initiating spin!

1584
02:10:07,174 --> 02:10:08,484
Come on, TARS.

1585
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,285
Come on, TARS!

1586
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:32,124
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1587
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:41,342
Easy.

1588
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:43,844
Easy.

1589
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:50,785
Retro thrusters!

1590
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,653
Main engines on.

1591
02:11:06,108 --> 02:11:09,019
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1592
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:18,796
Killing main engines!

1593
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,715
Okay, we are out of orbit.

1594
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:31,834
Okay. And for our next trick!

1595
02:11:33,469 --> 02:11:37,606
it will have to be good.
we are heading into Gargantua's pull.

1596
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,366
Oh,  .

1597
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,660
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1598
02:12:31,527 --> 02:12:33,963
Cooper, we are slipping towards Gargantua.

1599
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:37,224
Shall I use main engines?

1600
02:12:37,324 --> 02:12:41,503
No. We got to let her slide
as far as we can.

1601
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:52,948
- Give it to me.
- there is good news, there is bad news.

1602
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:56,777
Yeah, I have heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1603
02:13:05,519 --> 02:13:08,798
The backup generator kicked in,
so the systemys stable. they are all good.

1604
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:10,240
Good.

1605
02:13:10,357 --> 02:13:13,761
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1606
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:16,889
We do not have enough life support
to make it back to Earth, but...

1607
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:19,141
I think we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1608
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:23,596
- What about fuel?
- Not enough. But I have a plan.

1609
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:28,525
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1610
02:13:28,626 --> 02:13:31,946
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1611
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:34,615
- Manually?
- that is what I am here for.

1612
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:37,293
I am going to take us
just inside the critical orbit.

1613
02:13:37,393 --> 02:13:40,162
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1614
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:42,232
about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1615
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,162
I am sorry, Cooper.

1616
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,677
Once we have gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1617
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,912
we use Lander 1...

1618
02:13:57,112 --> 02:13:59,706
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

1619
02:14:00,274 --> 02:14:03,076
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1620
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:07,648
The Lender's linkages
have been destroyed...

1621
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:10,384
so we will have to control manually.

1622
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:14,622
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1623
02:14:14,722 --> 02:14:16,832
And get   into that black hole.

1624
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:18,885
Why does TARS have to detach?

1625
02:14:18,985 --> 02:14:21,495
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1626
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:23,038
Newton's third law.

1627
02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:25,916
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1628
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:27,626
is to leave something behind.

1629
02:14:27,726 --> 02:14:30,837
Cooper, you cannot ask TARS
to do this for us.

1630
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,842
he is a robot. So you do not have
to ask him to do anything.

1631
02:14:34,942 --> 02:14:38,662
- Cooper, you  !
- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1632
02:14:38,862 --> 02:14:41,348
it is what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1633
02:14:41,448 --> 02:14:43,976
it is our only chance
to save people on Earth.

1634
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:47,354
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum dato I will find in there...

1635
02:14:47,454 --> 02:14:49,590
they might still make it.

1636
02:14:50,533 --> 02:14:53,460
let us just hope
there is still someone there to save.

1637
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:23,415
Maximum velocity achieved.

1638
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,936
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1639
02:15:27,336 --> 02:15:29,772
- Ready?
- Ready.

1640
02:15:29,872 --> 02:15:33,067
- Ready.
- Main engine ignition in three...

1641
02:15:33,167 --> 02:15:34,635
two...

1642
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,895
one. Mark.

1643
02:15:50,225 --> 02:15:51,777
Come on, baby.

1644
02:15:52,645 --> 02:15:55,047
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1645
02:15:55,601 --> 02:15:57,800
Three, two...

1646
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,701
one. Mark.

1647
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:07,393
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1648
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:10,170
Three, two, one...

1649
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:11,880
- Mark.
- Fire!

1650
02:16:21,715 --> 02:16:25,185
This little maneuver's
going to cost us 51 years!

1651
02:16:25,761 --> 02:16:28,563
You do not sound so bad for pushing 120!

1652
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:47,124
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1653
02:16:47,491 --> 02:16:50,193
Three, two...

1654
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:54,056
- one. Mark.
- Detach!

1655
02:16:57,126 --> 02:16:59,695
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1656
02:16:59,795 --> 02:17:02,898
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1657
02:17:11,306 --> 02:17:13,191
Okay, CASE.

1658
02:17:13,634 --> 02:17:17,612
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1659
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:20,424
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1660
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:23,744
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1661
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,681
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1662
02:17:27,781 --> 02:17:30,267
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1663
02:17:30,367 --> 02:17:32,394
We agreed, Amelia...

1664
02:17:32,494 --> 02:17:34,254
90 percent.

1665
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:37,215
do not.

1666
02:17:39,126 --> 02:17:40,594
Detach.

1667
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:56,543
Okay, I am nosing down.

1668
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:02,240
Approaching the event horizon.

1669
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:08,997
Portside, dipping down beneath it
to go through it.

1670
02:18:10,282 --> 02:18:13,352
Heading towards blackness.

1671
02:18:13,452 --> 02:18:15,754
I have a visual of the event.

1672
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:17,631
it is all black.

1673
02:18:19,658 --> 02:18:23,261
TARS, do you read me? it is all blackness.

1674
02:18:24,963 --> 02:18:27,765
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1675
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:33,271
Okay.

1676
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:35,732
Screens...

1677
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:38,860
getting interference.

1678
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:43,156
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

1679
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,909
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1680
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:49,621
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

1681
02:18:55,994 --> 02:18:58,204
The computers are going down. Agh.

1682
02:19:09,925 --> 02:19:13,061
Gravitational pull.
I am losing control of the stick.

1683
02:19:46,128 --> 02:19:47,896
Murph? Murph, come on!

1684
02:19:53,468 --> 02:19:55,770
Eject. Eject.

1685
02:19:56,972 --> 02:19:58,356
Eject.

1686
02:19:58,473 --> 02:19:59,941
Eject.

1687
02:20:00,183 --> 02:20:01,526
Eject.

1688
02:20:01,935 --> 02:20:03,320
Eject.

1689
02:21:55,215 --> 02:21:56,558
Murph.

1690
02:22:06,226 --> 02:22:08,495
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1691
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:18,121
Murph.

1692
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:27,022
No, no, no!

1693
02:22:27,122 --> 02:22:28,482
Murph!

1694
02:22:28,582 --> 02:22:31,393
Murph! No! No!

1695
02:23:30,977 --> 02:23:33,038
If you are leaving, just go.

1696
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:34,706
No, no. No.

1697
02:23:36,191 --> 02:23:38,593
No, do not go. do not go, you idiot.

1698
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:40,286
do not go!

1699
02:23:41,947 --> 02:23:43,915
Morse. Morse.

1700
02:23:44,366 --> 02:23:45,708
Morse.

1701
02:23:46,418 --> 02:23:48,478
Dot. Dot.

1702
02:23:48,578 --> 02:23:49,921
S.

1703
02:23:55,752 --> 02:23:57,095
T.

1704
02:24:01,383 --> 02:24:02,534
A.

1705
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:03,918
Dash!

1706
02:24:06,513 --> 02:24:08,148
Dash! Dash!

1707
02:24:08,348 --> 02:24:09,458
Murph!

1708
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:11,860
Murph, we do not have time for this!
Come on!

1709
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:13,603
Y.

1710
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:19,742
"Stay!"

1711
02:24:30,537 --> 02:24:33,173
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1712
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,633
what is it say? what is it say, Murph?

1713
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:37,710
what is it say?

1714
02:24:47,762 --> 02:24:49,189
"Stay."

1715
02:25:24,633 --> 02:25:27,769
Tell him, Murph. Make him stay.

1716
02:25:31,188 --> 02:25:32,774
Make him stay, Murph.

1717
02:25:41,483 --> 02:25:43,660
Make him stay, Murph.

1718
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:47,247
do not let me leave, Murph!

1719
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,877
do not let me leave, Murph!

1720
02:25:58,475 --> 02:26:01,310
No! No! No!

1721
02:26:21,698 --> 02:26:23,499
It was you.

1722
02:26:34,369 --> 02:26:36,713
You were my ghost.

1723
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:49,734
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1724
02:26:50,927 --> 02:26:53,730
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1725
02:26:55,223 --> 02:26:58,151
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1726
02:26:58,393 --> 02:27:00,503
in their fifth dimension.

1727
02:27:00,603 --> 02:27:03,006
They saved us.

1728
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:08,386
Yeah? Who the   is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1729
02:27:08,486 --> 02:27:11,264
I do not know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1730
02:27:11,364 --> 02:27:14,726
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1731
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:16,853
Yeah, that am not working.

1732
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:18,563
Yes, it is.

1733
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:22,609
you have seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1734
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:25,845
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1735
02:27:26,212 --> 02:27:29,658
Gravity to send a message.

1736
02:27:29,958 --> 02:27:31,592
Affirmative.

1737
02:27:33,678 --> 02:27:35,304
Gravity...

1738
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,501
can cross the dimensions, including time.

1739
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:41,194
Apparently.

1740
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:47,075
Do you have the quantum dato?

1741
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:49,118
Roger. I have it.

1742
02:27:49,778 --> 02:27:53,848
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1743
02:27:53,948 --> 02:27:56,501
I can do this. I can do this.

1744
02:27:56,659 --> 02:27:59,479
But such complicated dato to a child?

1745
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:00,772
Not just any child.

1746
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:05,259
What else? Oh, come on, Dad.

1747
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,364
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1748
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:10,981
Even if you communicate it here,

1749
02:28:11,006 --> 02:28:13,768
she will not understand its
significance for years.

1750
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:15,787
I get that, TARS.

1751
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:20,625
But we have got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are going to die. Think!

1752
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:22,377
Cooper...

1753
02:28:22,477 --> 02:28:25,279
they did not bring us here
to change the past.

1754
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:30,135
Say that again.

1755
02:28:30,235 --> 02:28:33,996
They did not bring us here
to change the past.

1756
02:28:38,118 --> 02:28:40,378
No, they did not bring us here at all.

1757
02:28:44,707 --> 02:28:46,876
We brought ourselves.

1758
02:28:55,635 --> 02:28:59,981
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1759
02:29:00,223 --> 02:29:02,984
In binary. Roger. Feeding dato.

1760
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,418
"it is not a ghost."

1761
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,405
"it is gravity."

1762
02:29:32,505 --> 02:29:34,474
do not you get it yet, TARS?

1763
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:36,934
I brought myself here!

1764
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:41,314
we are here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1765
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:43,232
we are the bridge!

1766
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:53,034
I thought they chose me.

1767
02:29:56,070 --> 02:30:00,041
- But they did not choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

1768
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:04,212
To save the world.

1769
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:12,821
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1770
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:14,406
it is infinitely complex.

1771
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:19,327
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they are not bound by anything!

1772
02:30:19,427 --> 02:30:24,398
They cannot find a specific place in time.
They cannot communicate.

1773
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,670
that is why I am here.
I am going to find a way to tell Murph...

1774
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,338
just like I found this moment.

1775
02:30:30,438 --> 02:30:32,841
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1776
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:36,523
it is just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1777
02:30:36,723 --> 02:30:37,429
it is the key!

1778
02:30:37,529 --> 02:30:39,705
What are we here to do?

1779
02:30:40,323 --> 02:30:42,500
Find how to tell her.

1780
02:30:44,994 --> 02:30:46,629
The watch.

1781
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:50,925
The watch.

1782
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:53,427
that is it.

1783
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,933
We code the dato into the movement
of the second hand.

1784
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:05,540
TARS, translate the dato into Morse
and feed it to me.

1785
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,236
Translating dato to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1786
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:14,574
She will. She will.

1787
02:31:15,483 --> 02:31:17,410
Murph, I can see his car!

1788
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:19,587
he is coming, Murph!

1789
02:31:21,322 --> 02:31:23,457
Okay. I am coming down.

1790
02:31:24,617 --> 02:31:26,419
How do you know?

1791
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:31,465
Because I gave it to her.

1792
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:39,348
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1793
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:43,979
Dot-dot...

1794
02:31:45,013 --> 02:31:46,981
dash-dot.

1795
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:49,083
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1796
02:31:49,183 --> 02:31:52,153
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1797
02:31:52,353 --> 02:31:53,922
Dash-dash-dash.

1798
02:31:54,022 --> 02:31:56,574
Dash, dash, dash.

1799
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:16,377
He came back!

1800
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:21,265
It was him all the time!
I did not know. It was him!

1801
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:24,310
Dathes going to save us.

1802
02:33:06,761 --> 02:33:08,112
Eureka!

1803
02:33:11,766 --> 02:33:13,401
it is traditional.

1804
02:33:17,689 --> 02:33:19,615
Eureka!

1805
02:33:24,028 --> 02:33:25,597
Did it work?

1806
02:33:25,697 --> 02:33:27,832
I think it might have.

1807
02:33:28,908 --> 02:33:30,268
How do you know?

1808
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:34,046
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1809
02:33:37,583 --> 02:33:39,885
do not you get it yet, TARS?

1810
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:42,888
they are not "beings."

1811
02:33:43,256 --> 02:33:44,890
they are us.

1812
02:33:46,634 --> 02:33:50,062
What I have been doing for Murph,
they are doing for me.

1813
02:33:50,304 --> 02:33:51,873
For all of us.

1814
02:33:51,973 --> 02:33:54,292
Cooper, people could not build this.

1815
02:33:54,392 --> 02:33:57,045
No. No, not yet.

1816
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:58,904
But one day.

1817
02:33:59,272 --> 02:34:02,783
Not you and me. But people.

1818
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:07,496
A civilization that is evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1819
02:34:13,786 --> 02:34:15,588
What happens now?

1820
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:19,652
Mr. Cooper.

1821
02:35:23,564 --> 02:35:25,574
All right. let us take it slow, sir.

1822
02:35:25,691 --> 02:35:27,885
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1823
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:33,332
Remember, you are no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1824
02:35:40,039 --> 02:35:41,674
Take it slow, sir.

1825
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:44,819
You were... extremely lucky.

1826
02:35:44,919 --> 02:35:48,556
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1827
02:36:02,436 --> 02:36:04,071
Where am I?

1828
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:07,283
Cooper Station.

1829
02:36:08,401 --> 02:36:10,244
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1830
02:36:11,946 --> 02:36:14,290
Cooper Station.

1831
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,519
Nice of you to name it after me.

1832
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,441
What?

1833
02:36:23,541 --> 02:36:26,952
The station is not named after you, sir.
it is... named after your daughter.

1834
02:36:27,253 --> 02:36:30,323
Although she is always maintained
just how important you were.

1835
02:36:30,423 --> 02:36:32,433
Is she still alive?

1836
02:36:34,093 --> 02:36:36,271
She shall be here in a couple weeks.

1837
02:36:37,013 --> 02:36:39,540
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1838
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,318
but when she heard
that you would been found...

1839
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:46,038
well, this is... Murphy Cooper
we are talking about.

1840
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,616
Yes, it is.

1841
02:36:50,443 --> 02:36:53,245
we will have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1842
02:36:55,615 --> 02:36:58,417
I am sure you will be excited to see
what is in store.

1843
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:03,564
I actually... did a paper on you
in high school.

1844
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:06,300
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

1845
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:08,903
Oh, yeah.

1846
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:10,554
Right.

1847
02:37:12,673 --> 02:37:18,312
If... If you will follow me,
we have got a really good situation for you.

1848
02:37:21,349 --> 02:37:25,694
So... when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1849
02:37:26,312 --> 02:37:29,606
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1850
02:37:32,485 --> 02:37:35,847
It was just constant.
Just that steady   of dirt.

1851
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:38,933
Of course,
I did not speak to her personally.

1852
02:37:39,033 --> 02:37:41,102
We always set the plate upside-down.

1853
02:37:41,202 --> 02:37:44,021
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1854
02:37:44,121 --> 02:37:49,110
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1855
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:51,737
There just was not enough food.

1856
02:37:51,837 --> 02:37:54,615
We wore little things, little strips...

1857
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:59,954
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we would not breathe so much of it.

1858
02:38:00,054 --> 02:38:03,583
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1859
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:07,962
I do not care who describes it, there is
no way for it to be exaggerated.

1860
02:38:08,062 --> 02:38:11,966
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

1861
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:15,411
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah. Come here.

1862
02:38:15,695 --> 02:38:20,725
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it...

1863
02:38:27,039 --> 02:38:29,150
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1864
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,320
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1865
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,156
Its... power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1866
02:38:35,256 --> 02:38:37,725
Yes. Please.

1867
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:40,269
Settings.

1868
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:42,229
General settings.

1869
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:44,565
Security settings.

1870
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:49,570
Honesty, new setting:

1871
02:38:50,438 --> 02:38:52,298
95 percent.

1872
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:55,200
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1873
02:38:55,776 --> 02:38:57,202
Humor:

1874
02:38:58,404 --> 02:39:00,181
75 percent.

1875
02:39:00,281 --> 02:39:01,915
Confirmed.

1876
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,478
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

1877
02:39:05,578 --> 02:39:07,796
let us make that 60 percent.

1878
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:12,218
Sixty percent confirmed.

1879
02:39:12,543 --> 02:39:15,929
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1880
02:39:20,509 --> 02:39:22,936
Is this really what it was like?

1881
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:27,566
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

1882
02:39:31,771 --> 02:39:35,741
I do not care much for this pretending
we are back where we started.

1883
02:39:37,526 --> 02:39:40,120
I want to know where we are.

1884
02:39:41,447 --> 02:39:43,290
Where we are going.

1885
02:39:47,536 --> 02:39:50,690
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1886
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,941
Family?

1887
02:39:52,041 --> 02:39:56,120
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She is
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1888
02:40:28,994 --> 02:40:31,577
You told them I like farming.

1889
02:40:36,836 --> 02:40:39,004
It was me, Murph.

1890
02:40:40,965 --> 02:40:43,058
I was your ghost.

1891
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:45,978
I know.

1892
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:52,251
People did not believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

1893
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:53,694
But...

1894
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:58,732
I knew who it was.

1895
02:41:03,195 --> 02:41:05,664
Nobody believed me.

1896
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:08,484
But I knew you would come back.

1897
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,379
How?

1898
02:41:14,081 --> 02:41:17,509
Because my dad promised me.

1899
02:41:23,257 --> 02:41:25,559
Well, I am here now, Murph.

1900
02:41:26,452 --> 02:41:28,387
I am here.

1901
02:41:29,346 --> 02:41:30,881
No.

1902
02:41:32,766 --> 02:41:37,196
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1903
02:41:39,815 --> 02:41:42,984
I have my kids here for me now.

1904
02:41:44,979 --> 02:41:47,080
You go.

1905
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,502
Where?

1906
02:41:54,705 --> 02:41:56,590
Brand.

1907
02:42:05,933 --> 02:42:08,260
She is out there...

1908
02:42:13,783 --> 02:42:16,235
setting up camp.

1909
02:42:42,419 --> 02:42:44,429
Alone...

1910
02:42:45,297 --> 02:42:48,267
in a strange galaxy.

1911
02:42:58,852 --> 02:43:03,824
Maybe right now
she is settling in for the long nap...

1912
02:43:21,875 --> 02:43:25,012
by the light of our new sun...

1913
02:43:40,185 --> 02:43:42,529
in our new home.

1914
02:43:43,305 --> 02:43:49,316
