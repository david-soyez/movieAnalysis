between "Pretty" Ricky
Conlan and Danny Wheeler.

361
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,240
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

364

366

Hey, Unc!

368
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,763
Unc!

369
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,899
How you doing?

370
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,501
Did you call me "Unc"?

371
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,003
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

372
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,772
What's an "O.G."?

373
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,174
Old-ass gangster.

374
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,641
"Unc" is good.

375
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,176
I can do that.

376
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,278
It's all good.

377
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,246
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

378
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,149
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

379
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,516
Figured I'd stop by.

380
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:37,254
Okay.

381
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,621
Maybe ask you a question.

382
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,859
Sure. I can do all this.

383
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,092
Uh...

384
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,595
What are some drills I can
do to get my hand speed up?

385
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,531
Some guys up there, I
bet they can help you.

386
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,966
There's a guy there named Pete.

387
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,668
He's a pretty good trainer.

388
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,603
Yeah, but he's with his
fighter most of the time.

389
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,674
I mostly just train myself.

390
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,244
They know you're a Creed?

391
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,312
I don't go by that.

392
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,546
I'm trying to make it on my own.

393
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:05,747
Name's Johnson.

394
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,150
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

395
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:11,553
Plus, just makes life easier.

396
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,557
Uh-huh.

397
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,394
Plus, you know, if you train me

398
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,695
ain't nobody around here knows me.

399
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,666
We could fly under the radar.

400
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,168
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

401
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,602
I told you before,

402
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,806
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

403
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,576
That's cool, but maybe you could just

404
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,178
give me some drills.

405
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,882
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

406
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,620
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

407
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,957
My God.

408
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,930
All right. I got a few.

409
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,932
But that's it. Okay?

410
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,001
Of course.

411
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:02,072
Five rounds of jumping rope.

412
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,575
Three rounds on each of the bags...

413
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,044
When you get to the heavy bag,

414
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,545
just don't keep throwing your hands

415
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,180
because you can hurt them.

416
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,016
It's also about using your legs, all right?

417
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:19,022
And then five rounds of...

418
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,689
Shadow...

419
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:21,858
O-W.

420
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,959
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

421
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,630
And that's it.

422
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,563
- All right?
- Yeah.

423
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,233
Okay, here you go.

424
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,399
Oh, that is perfect.

425
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:34,236
Good luck with that.

426
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:35,537
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

427
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,875
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

428
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,651
All right, man.

429
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,586
Wait, don't you want this?

430
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,786
I got it right here.

431
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,622
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

432
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,693
It's already up in the cloud.

433
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:03,100
What cloud? What cloud?

434
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,302
Hey, Ma, it's me.

435
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,237
I was just calling to let
you know I'm doing good

436
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,140
and I got an apartment.

437
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,110
<i>It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.</i>

438
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,012
<i>I miss you.</i>

439
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,613
<i>I wanna hear from you,</i>

440
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:21,118
so call me back when you
get a chance. All right.

What, it's too loud?

444
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,842
No, I just heard you down here working.

445
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,544
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

446
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,912
Maybe get some food?

447
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,113
Where you from, Donnie?

448
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,715
I'm from L.A.

449
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,685
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

450
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,387
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

451
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,721
Not a date.

452
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,724
Right.

453
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,794
You know what? It's all good.

454
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,661
It's okay.

455
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,531
Hey, yo.

456
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,002
I am hungry.

457
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,874
I only have an hour. Do
you know where you wanna go?

458
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,909
I was hoping you could tell me.

459
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,146
You're from Philly, right?

460
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,018
Okay.

461
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,725
Good luck, man.

462
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,771
ADONIS: So where are we?

463
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,238
BIANCA: North Philly.

464
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,573
So this is Max's.

465
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:54,209
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

466
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,777
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

467
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,345
You looking wonderful as always.

468
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:58,782
Thank you.

469
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,216
How you doing there, my friend?

470
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,517
This my neighbor and he's a West Coast boy.

471
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,785
Ain't never had a steak before.

472
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,721
Listen, I'm gonna treat
him like he was my neighbor.

473

That's how good we gonna take care of you.

- BIANCA: You like pickles?
- ADONIS: Nah.

475
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,259
BIANCA: Okay, mayonnaise.

476
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,594
Put extra peppers on that jawn, both kinds.

477
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,730
Ketchup, extra cheese.

478
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,765
- ADONIS: How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

479
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,467
No, let me get these.

480
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,636
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

481
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,938
You said it wasn't a date, though.

482
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,374
It's not.

483
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,441
Where we eating at?

484
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:27,909
Right there.

485
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,211
ADONIS: <i>So I heard you back
there, "jawn" this, "jawn" that.</i>

486
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,281
<i>What's a "jawn"?</i>

487
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,982
It's a noun.

488
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,119
See, these is jawns.

489
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,586
This is a jawn.

490
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,723
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

491
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,457
You got a jawn?

492
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,059
Like, a dude?

493
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,826
No.

494
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,896
I got too much going on right now.

495
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,130
Shows and stuff?

496
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,399
Yeah.

497
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,834
I'm opening at Electric Factory next month.

498
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,002
What's that?

499
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,336
It's a big venue out here.

500
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,005
A lot of people got their start.

501
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,742
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

502
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,112
That's wassup.

503
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,813
Can I ask you something personal?

504
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,950
Mmm-hmm.

505
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:13,823
I got progressive hearing loss.

506
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,659
Just started wearing these this past year.

507
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,494
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

508
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,595
For now.

509
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:23,365
So it's progressive, so eventually...

510
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:26,201
Yeah.

511
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,937
Yeah.

512
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,470
I'm just getting ready for it.

513
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,706
Like I'm getting used to these,

514
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,809
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

515
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,214
But I really can only remember bad words.

516
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,419
Ones that aren't that useful like...

517
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,321
(CHUCKLES) The fuck's that?

518
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,559
You can't tell? This is the
bull, the horns, this is...

519
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,894
Yeah, this is bullshit.

520
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,062
That's your favorite?

521
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,996
(CHUCKLES) Uh-huh.

522
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:57,533
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

523
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,869
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

524
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,937
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

525
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,840
- Like what?
- Like street.

526
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,042
I'm not saying you're a square or anything,

527
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,743
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

528
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:10,045
My pop was a fighter.

529
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,248
Oh, right. That makes sense.

530
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,317
Did he fight pro?

531
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,484
Something like that.

532
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,420
Does he train you?

533
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:21,325
My pop died before I was born.

534
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,029
I'm sorry to hear that.

535
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,634
So what made you wanna sing?

536
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,241
Uh...

537
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,279
It makes me feel alive.

538
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,882
Where's your next show?

539
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,118
That place that you saw
me at, Johnny Brenda's.

540
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,790
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

541
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,726
Can I roll with you?

542
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:02,433
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

543
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:07,270
Let me think on it.

544
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,092
Okay.

545
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:34,763
Here we go, Paulie.

546
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,935
Happy birthday, my friend.

547
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,837
I didn't forget ya.

548
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,239
Your favorite.

549
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,109
Miss ya, pal.

550
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:51,679
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

551
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:54,618
The best of the best.

552
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,187
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

553
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,591
It's getting harder to walk up
this hill. What does that mean?

554
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:05,761
Anyway, it's a good day today.

555
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,029
It's a good day, got no problems.

556
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,765
Bills are paid.

557
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,933
Only thing is, it's tough to

558
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:14,304
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

559
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,873
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

560
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,946
Anyway, shall we see what's
new in the world today?

561
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,953
Whoa.

562
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,120
Hey, Rocky!

563
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,355
Hey, how you doing?

564
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,190
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

565
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,092
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

566
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,928
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

567
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,429
MAN: Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.

568
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,730
ROCKY: How you doing?

569
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,232
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

570
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,433
Welcome back, man. It's been a while.

571
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,500
Yeah, thank you very much.

572
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,569
- How do you feel?
- Good.

573
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,437
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

574
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,272
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

575
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,373
Didn't know you were coming by.

576
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,607
I didn't either.

577
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,676
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

578
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,944
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

579
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,379
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

580
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,982
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

581
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,449
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

582
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,317
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky,

583
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,020
he's 17 and 0.

584
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,089
Things are really opening up for us.

585
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,658
Leo! Come.

586
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,029
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

587
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,165
Little training, little motivation.

588
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,600
Let me think about it.

589
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,667
Sure, sure.

590
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,768
How you doing, kid?

591
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,870
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

592
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,904
ROCKY: Nice to meet you,
too. 17 and 0, very good.

593
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,007
LEO: Yeah, I was supposed to
fight on the Ricky Conlan's card...

594
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,911
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

595
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,212
Unc.

596
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,246
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

597
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,716
- You made it.
- Yeah.

598
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,752
Just walked by. Here I am.

599
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,120
How you know Hollywood?

600
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,089
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

601
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,426
That's it.

602
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,163
Okay, Rock. Okay.

603
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,799
You need anything, you let me know.

604
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,667
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

605
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:26,935
Thanks.

606
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:31,272
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

607
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,943
Can I talk to you a minute?

608
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,183
I don't really know what I'm doing here

609
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,451
because I got other plans for my life

610
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,120
and this wasn't part of it.

611
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,123
Your father was special.

612
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,458
Tell you the truth, I don't
know if you're special.

613
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,928
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

614
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,529
It ain't gonna come overnight.

615
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,230
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

616
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,299
you're gonna get knocked
down, you're gonna get up

617
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,402
and you're gonna see if
you got the right thing.

618
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:02,036
But, you gotta work hard.

619
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,839
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

620
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,308
I'm out.

621
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,045
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

622
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,549
Nobody showed me how to do this.

623
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,186
I'm ready.

624
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,390
Come on. Let's do this.

625

I am serious. This is old school.

628

grab one of these birds.

Yeah, in your dreams.

Come on! You call that fast?

632

No! Again.

That's pretty good.

00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,476
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

652
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:52,080
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

653
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,248
You see this guy here staring back at you?

654
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,317
Yeah.

655
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,120
That's your toughest opponent.

Every time you get into the ring,

657

that's who you're going against.

do believe that in life, okay?

659
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,462
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

660
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,297
All right, one to the gut.

661
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,900
Now, every time you punch
this guy, what's he doing?

662

- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

it or get out of the way. Go.

- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

716
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,214
People will come out to see
you in the corner again, champ.

717

We'll make it like the old
days. Get the whole city there.

ROCKY: No, I understand that.

But I'm just getting used
to this kid right now,

721
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,690
and, you know, he's
getting better every day

722
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:24,359
but he's gonna take a while.

723
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,527
He's hungry.

724
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,031
You gotta feed him every
now and again. You know that.

725
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,699
Thanks. I appreciate it,
chef. We'll be okay. Thanks.

726
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:35,036
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

727
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:37,004
Rock, what we training for?

728
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:38,339
Yeah, what are we training for?

729
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,942
We're training to win, not get
killed. You're not ready yet.

730
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,944
I can lose five pounds. I can
lose five pounds like that.

731
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,679
It's nothing, it's easy.

732

Come on.

734
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,121
This kid's like a tough
Philadelphia fighter.

735
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,024
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

736
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,357
Yeah, but I've been watching him,

737
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,060
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

738
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,194
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

739
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,263
Oh, okay.

740
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,397
All right, listen.

741
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,866
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

742
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,967
Are you crazy?

743
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,004
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

744
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,205
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

745
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,841
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it
takes. At the end of the six weeks,

746

00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,813
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

go get my stuff right now.

752
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,484
So I can move into your spot.

754
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,621
No, no one's been in
my house in a long time

755
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:29,257

be comfortable there.

757
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,661
No.

758
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,931
We're good then.

759
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,745
You better not walk around naked either.

760
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,112
That's for sure.

but I'm gonna be living
with my uncle for a while,

He's white.

00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,540
Yeah, a long time.

773
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,545
He's gonna be staying with
me, and when we ain't training

774
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,712
you're welcome to come on over.

775

Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

776
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,087
Why you giving me that look?

777
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:37,458
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

778
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,726
I'm gonna call you.

779
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:42,031
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

looks kind of nice.</i>

781
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,306
You like her?

782
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

783
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:54,243
Yeah.

Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

785
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:58,880
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

786
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,781
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

787
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,685
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

788
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,819
What happened to him?

789
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:07,688
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

790
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,257
Kind of a mess. We'll
straighten it up later.

791
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,694
It'll be comfortable.

792

Oh, man, this is a dope
pic! That's your boy?

793
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,335
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

794
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,837
Did you train him, too?

795
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,643
I tried, but he just didn't
like fighting, didn't take to it.

796
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:30,745
He still around here?

797
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,216
No, he moved to a place called
Vancouver with his girlfriend.

798
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,051
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

799
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:39,254
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

800
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,457
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

801
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,361
Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.

802
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,665
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

Why don't you unpack, all right?

804
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:57,940

in the morning, all right?

- Okay.

want you to run alongside.

01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,728
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1232
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,364
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta be fast

1233
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,400
because we're training.

1234
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,834
<i>I can be there. Couple of days.</i>

1235
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,703
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1236
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,773
Okay.

1237
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:11,611
Oh, man.

1238
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:13,780
TOMMY: Thanks for taking the
time. I'll get right to it.

1239
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:18,218
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1240
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,355
and we've beaten everybody.

1241
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,457
You want me to fight Conlan?

1242
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,692
I think it would be a very wise move.

1243
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,695
TOMMY: You've been down in
Mexico doing pro fights, eh?

1244
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:30,097
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1245
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,598
And with the Sporino
fight, that makes you 16-0.

1246
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,968
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1247
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,806
were in some hole in the wall, do they, eh?

1248
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,110
You think I'm ready?

1249
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,913
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1250
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,013
Right? It's a sure victory.

1251
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,550
That is not true.

1252
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,121
Yeah, it is.

1253
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,390
Okay, listen.

1254
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,924
All right.

1255
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:02,128
This could be my guy's last fight.

1256
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,097
And I wanna make it count.

1257
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,231
Now, on that note,

1258
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:07,801
we would need you to
change your name to Creed.

1259
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:10,139
It's just a formality.

1260
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:18,111
And what if I say no?

1261
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,748
Well, then there's no fight.

1262
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,115
Without the name, there's no fight.

1263
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:25,418
It's a non-starter.

1264
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,721
Okay. Okay.

1265
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:30,423
Why don't you both take
a day, talk about it

1266
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:34,094
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1267
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,364
It's a good deal.

1268
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:37,932
Can't do it.

1269
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,868
Nah, it's not my name.

1270
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:44,437
And plus, I wanna make
it on my own merit anyway.

1271
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:45,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1272
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,609
You got a funny way of showing it.

1273
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:49,977
What's that supposed to mean?

1274
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,346
I mean, weren't Apollo and
Rocky like best friends?

1275
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,982
It feels like you're trying to tap
into whatever it is he left behind.

1276
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:59,285
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1277
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:00,387
What are you afraid of?

1278
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,324
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1279
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:04,391
I don't know.

1280
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,793
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1281
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,795
Uh...

1282
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:12,165
I always knew it would happen eventually

1283
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:15,235
so my plan has always just been

1284
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:19,205
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1285
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:23,375
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1286
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:26,948
So, what are you afraid of?

1287
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:31,752
I'm afraid of taking
on the name and losing.

1288
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,487
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1289
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:37,490
Why don't you think about what's true?

1290
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:40,495
You love to fight, right?

1291
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:43,297
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

1292
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,365
Yeah.

1293
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:48,504
Yeah, and you are Apollo
Creed's son, right?

1294
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,837
Yes.

1295
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:54,107
So then use the name.

1296
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,678
It's yours.

I know you don't want me to do this, right?

1303
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,976
I can think of better things to do, Donnie.

1304
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:33,280
But if we did do it

1305
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,450
how we get it done?

1306
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:41,356
Mmm.

1307
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,626
Well...

1308
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:53,232
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1309
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:56,102
Definitely has a lot
more experience than you.

1310
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,437
And he's faster than you are.

1311
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:59,940
He's the champion.

1312
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,575
And since he's the champion,

1313
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,678
you gotta bring the
fight to him, like I did.

1314
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:11,051
You gotta go to the body.
Dig. And in doing that

1315
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,819
you're in a very dangerous place

1316
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,588
because you can get laid out.

1317
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,326
It ain't easy for me to
be in your corner, kid.

Now, I wanna throw the
hook on the same side.

So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1426
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:49,294
Well, we went through your test results

1427
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:51,397
and your biopsy came back showing signs

1428
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:55,968
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1429
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,038
What's that do?

1430
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,276
Well, it's a form of cancer.

I know that sounds scary,

1432
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,619
but the good news is we caught it early.

1433
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:16,589
However, we will have to remove
the tumor in your lymph nodes

1434
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:20,994
and start chemotherapy immediately.

1435
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,996
My wife tried that.

1436
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:26,633
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

1437
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,067
this is the best plan of action.

1438
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:30,404
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

1439
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,405
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1440
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:35,708
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1441
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,143
With treatment, you'll still have

1442
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,379
a very good chance of recovery.

1443
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,649

is. He's been there before.</i>

of nervous energy</i>

Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:28,905
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

2246
02:02:28,907 --> 02:02:30,106
I got my family right here.

2247
02:02:30,108 --> 02:02:33,444
Without them, none of this
would've been possible.

2248
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:37,481
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

2249
02:02:37,483 --> 02:02:38,650
What does that mean to you?

2250
02:02:38,652 --> 02:02:42,084
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

2251
02:02:42,086 --> 02:02:46,255
He's a real fighter, and he's
helping me fight a few things,

2252
02:02:46,257 --> 02:02:48,659
so I appreciate it. I really do.

2253
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:51,661
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

2254
02:02:51,663 --> 02:02:55,200
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

2255
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:01,438
I'll just tell him that I love him

2256
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:04,575
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

2257
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:08,380
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

2258
02:03:09,616 --> 02:03:11,182
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations

2259
02:03:11,184 --> 02:03:14,017
on a sensational performance. Jim.

(ROCKY SIGHS)

2276
02:04:29,194 --> 02:04:31,594
I just wanna see if I
can get up these steps.

2277
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:33,297
When's the first time you came here?

2278
02:04:33,299 --> 02:04:36,234
I was 12.

2279
02:04:36,236 --> 02:04:39,671
I think it's my favorite place.

2280
02:04:44,542 --> 02:04:47,677
When you get to the top

2281
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,348

2286

Come on, young man.

2287
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:21,811
Just let me catch my breath.

2288
02:05:21,813 --> 02:05:23,981
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

2289
02:05:23,983 --> 02:05:25,915
Just a minute.

2290
02:05:25,917 --> 02:05:27,985
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

2291
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:31,289
Let's go. One step at a time.

2292
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:33,824
Yeah.

2293
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:36,994
Come on.

2294
02:05:36,996 --> 02:05:40,897
One step at a time. Who told you that?

2295
02:05:40,899 --> 02:05:42,132
Some old guy.

2296
02:05:42,134 --> 02:05:44,602
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

2298
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:51,008
I think they added a few more steps.

2299

I don't know.

2300
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:53,377
Almost there.

2301
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:55,279

Oh, good. Really good.

Yeah.

02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:12,631
Nice view.

2308
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:19,936
If you look hard enough, you can
see your whole life from up here.

2309
02:06:19,938 --> 02:06:21,637
How does it look?

2310
02:06:21,639 --> 02:06:25,107
Not bad at all. And you?

2311
02:06:25,109 --> 02:06:27,779
Not bad at all.
