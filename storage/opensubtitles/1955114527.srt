And when the majority

256
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,364

Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds

274

were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

on their 2% fee

they got for selling each of these bonds.

277
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,079
But then they started running out
of mortgages to put in them.

278
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,832
After all, there are only so many homes

279
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,669
and so many people with
good enough jobs to buy them, right?

280
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,838
So the banks started filling these bonds

281
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,090
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

That way they can keep

284
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:26,434
By the way, these risky mortgages
are called subprime.

285
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,894

And I go in for a scan.

Mmm-hmm.

528
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:29,072
Turns out that I have a very large thing
called an epididymis.

529
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,700
Which is a thing that goes around the ball

530
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,493
and is like a sac underneath.

531
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,619
I have an extremely

- PORTER: I'm riveted...

533
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,665

Do you have any pictures?

DANNY: It's almost as large
as another testicle unto itself.

00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:44,462
So get this. Cynthia...

JARED: Mark refused to kiss the ring
of the people with the checkbooks,

541
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,103
so he had to set up his fund
under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.

He worked with Baum at a previous firm

the wrong FrontPoint.

in this same building that is bonds.

who was talking about
shorting housing bonds.

571
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,999
And then in the middle of the call
I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.

And then... 'Cause he wanted

have you talked to about this trade?

All right? The originals were simple.

626
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,669
They were just thousands
of AAA mortgages bundled together,

627
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,505
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

628
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,423
The modern ones are different.

629
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,443
They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

630
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,101
The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

631
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,354
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,
taking on defaults first.

632
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,107
Now, obviously, if you're buying B's,
you could make more money.

633
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,358
But they're a little risky.

634
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,627
Sometimes they fail.

00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,213
Chris?

636
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,285
Somewhere along the line,
these B's and BB's

637
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,829
went from a little risky

638
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,331
to dog shit. Where's the trash?

from 1% to 4%, fellas.

And if they rise to 8%, and they will,

a lot of these BBB's
are going to zero, too.

651

You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail
and we are already at 4%?

652
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:19,154
That's right.

653

Jared likes to say I don't because he
thinks it makes me seem more authentic.

670

national math competition.

you can make 10-to-1, even 20-to-1 return.

676

getting paid obscene fees

are pretty nice and fat.

my margins, by the way.

00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,354
How can these underlying bonds
be as bad as you say?

693
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,672
It wouldn't be legal. (CLEARS THROAT)

694
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,715
Nobody knows what's in them.

695
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,300
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.

696
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,470
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated

697
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,515
that I know for a fact are filled with 95%

698
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:13,409
subprime shit with FICOs below 550!

699
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,978
Get the fuck out of here.

700
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,437
You want me to really blow your mind?

701
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:20,358
When the market deems a bond too risky
to buy, what do you think we do with it?

702
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,568
Take a guess.

703
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,069
I don't know. You tell me.

704
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:27,073
All right. You think we just
warehouse it on the books? No.

705
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,075
We just repackage it
with a bunch of other shit

706
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,260
that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.

707
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,138
- MARK: A CDO?
- JARED: Yes. A CDO.

708
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,666
- What is that?
- This is where we take a bunch of B's,

709
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,918
BB's and BBB's that haven't sold,

710
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,687
- and we put them in a pile.
- (CLATTERING)

711
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,190
JARED: And when the pile
gets large enough,

712
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,843
the whole thing is suddenly
considered diversified

713
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:51,639
and the whores at the rating agency
give it a 92%-93% AAA rating,

714
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,741
no questions asked.

Hold it. What? Say that again.

717
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:00,440
A collateralized debt obligation.

718
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,025
It's important to understand
because it's what allowed

719
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:06,237
a housing crisis to become
a nationwide economic disaster.

720
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:09,549
Here's world-famous chef
Anthony Bourdain to explain.

721
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,050
(LAUGHS)

722
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,805
ANTHONY:
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon

723
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,640
setting the menu at a big restaurant.

724
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,208
I ordered my fish on Friday,

725
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,019
which is the mortgage bond
that Michael Burry shorted.

726
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,213
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

727
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,675
I don't know why. Maybe it just came out
halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.

728
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,469
So, what am I going to do?

729
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:33,056
Throw all this unsold fish,
which is the BBB level of the bond,

730
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,616
in the garbage and take the loss?

731
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,560
No way.

732
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,063
Being the crafty
and morally onerous chef that I am,

733
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,832
whatever crappy levels
of the bond I don't sell,

734
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,901
I throw into a seafood stew.

735
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:48,404
See, it's not old fish.
It's a whole new thing!

736
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:52,200
And the best part is
they're eating 3-day-old halibut.

737
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,968
That is a CDO.

738
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,913
PORTER: I just need to know,
how could these possibly be collated?

739
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,415
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer

740
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,750
and you're the first person

741
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,168
- who found this thing.
- Hold on. Hold on.

742
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,128
So mortgage bonds are dog shit,

743
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,422
CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit.

744
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,523
(BUZZING)

745
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,801
Yeah, that's right.

746
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:13,388
Institutions treat these CDOs
like they're as solid as treasury bonds,

747
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,722
and they're going to zero.

748
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:15,848
(CLATTERING)

749
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,142
DANNY: No. That can't be right.
There were $500 billion

750
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,578
in housing bonds sold last year alone.

751
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,481
The rating agencies, the banks,
the fucking government,

752
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,566
you're saying they're
all asleep at the wheel?

753
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:29,128
Yeah. My whole department's
long on this stuff.

754
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,883
They call me Chicken Little.
They call me Bubble Boy.

755

- A's, zero. B's, zero.

He's playing us.

773
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,754
He's playing us.
He's got too much skin in the game

774
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,522
and he's dumping his position.

775
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,966
What if he's right?

776
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,134
You want him to be right.

777
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,777
MARK: Yes, I do.

778
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,431
The banks have given us
25% interest rates on credit cards.

779
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,224
They have screwed us on student loans

780
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,059
that we can never get out from under.

781
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,354
Then this guy walks into
my office and says

782
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,399
those same banks got greedy,
they lost track of the market,

783
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,526
and I can profit off of their stupidity?

784
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,862
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!

785
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,197

786
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,948
He's everything
you taught us not to trust.

787
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,742
I can't hate him. He is so transparent

788
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,203
in his self-interest
that I kind of respect him.

- Would I buy a car from him? No.

Look. It's two very simple questions.

00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,173
Is there a housing bubble?

And if there is,
how exposed are the banks?

00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,177
but I was the first to do this trade.

1037
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,722
Watch. It will pay. I may have
been early, but I'm not wrong.

1038
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,158
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing, Mike!

1039
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:53,121
You're managing a fund of,
what, $555 million?

1040
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:57,167
In six years, it'll all be gone.

1041
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,361
On one bet.

1042
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:02,631
No, the second quarter of '07 is
when the adjustable rates kick in.

1043
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,241
The defaults will skyrocket.

1044
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,034
Yeah. Says you.

1045
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,579
LAWRENCE: How much is eligible
for withdrawal before they do?

1046
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,597
Say, in the next two quarters.

1047
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,308
If your investors panic.

1048
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,880
$302 million?

1049
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,981
I...

1050
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,483
My God, Mike.

1051
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:23,944
(MIKE CHUCKLES)

1052
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,223
No one will pull out.
That would be suicide.

1053
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,742
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

1054
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,145
But if they trust me,
and they trust me, because...

1055
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,856
No one trusts you! No one!

1056
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,375
I sent several emails to my investors

1057
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,544
letting them know that the...

1058
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,070
(EXHALES)

1059
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,590
...the second quarter of '07 is when our

1060
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,175
housing positions show returns and...

1061
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,803
I've been very clear.

1062
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:53,432
People will withdraw their money.

1063
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:57,461
Lawrence, that would be so stupid.
I mean, the...

1064
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:01,064
(STUTTERS) If the fund's capitals
drop too much,

1065
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,593
then the swaps contracts are voided.

1066
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:07,930
And then the banks get to
keep all of the collateral.

1067
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,240
- MARTIN: Wait a minute. Wait.
- All of it.

1068
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,476
The contracts are voided?

1069
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,369
The contracts are voided?

1070
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,747
Holy shit!

1071
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,206
Oh, motherfucker!

Give me my money back.

1074

Michael, do you hear me?
I want my money back.

1075
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,056
Give me my fucking money back...

1076

(LAUGHS)...you motherfucker.

1077
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,562
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

1078
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,923
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy.

1079
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,900
"Let's just all calm down."

1080
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:49,946
I sold that house for $350,000
the year it was built.

1081
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,783
Two years later, $480,000.

1082
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:56,078
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1083
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,747
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

1084
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,066
He'd let it go for that.

1085
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,818
Hi, John.

1086
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:03,960
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.

1087
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,962
It will break his heart,
but he'll let it go.

1088
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,823
Why is he selling?

1089
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,758
MARLENE: Neither one's working right now.

1090
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,370
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

1091
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,456
As motivated as one can be
in this neighborhood.

1092
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:19,084
This house on the left,
I would say they're probably motivated.

1093
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:21,128
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.

1094
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:22,312
MARLENE: Oh, it's just the gully.

1095
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,339
That's all. Just...

1096
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,841
Just nerves.

1097
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,651
So where do we stand?

1098
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:31,305
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

to a mortgage broker?

1101
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,476
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.

1102
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,562

(ALL LAUGHING)

1106
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:45,460
So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

1107
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:49,840
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge
fund, but we're not really part of it.

1108
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:52,409
We invest in financial service companies

1109
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:55,454
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1110
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,473
How many loans do you write each month?

1111
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,125
- (BLOWS AIR) About 60.
- Yeah.

1112
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,685
What was it four years ago?

1113
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:03,962

Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.

1116
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:08,717
(LAUGHING) You own a...

1117
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:12,054
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1118
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:13,805
- MAN IN BLACK: Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1119
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,849
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1120
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:19,061
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

1121
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,437
Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1122
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:23,065

They're not confessing.

they sign where you tell them to sign.

I make $2,000
on a fixed-rate prime loan, right?

1374
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,759
I spoke with Mark Baum.
He says to fuck off.

any appointment they'll give me,

1378
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,075

gets shot to hell!

1379
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,744

1382
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,527
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1383
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:40,862
VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why

1384
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:43,573
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1385
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:46,701
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1386
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,203
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

1387
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:51,080
but they're actually within our models.

1388
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,140
- So...
- VINNIE: Says you.

1389
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,711
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

1390
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:59,230
in these bonds are solid loans.

1391
01:04:59,355 --> 01:05:01,215
GEORGIA: That is our opinion, yes.

1392
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,384
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1393
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,219
I mean, they're giving these loans

1394
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:06,554
to anybody with a credit score
and a pulse.

1395

we do here all day?

That's why we're here.

1398
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,369

are so stable...

1400

- GEORGIA: We stand behind them.

1403
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:22,945
MARK: Georgia,
have you ever refused to rate

1404
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,324
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

1405
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:27,992
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?

1406
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:30,077
I am under no obligation
to share that information

1407
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,245
with you, whoever you might be.

1408
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,055
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1409
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,542
Can you name one time in the past year
where you checked the tape

1410
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:40,855
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

1411
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,258
If we don't give them the ratings,

1412
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,277
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

1413
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,531
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

1414
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:54,368
Not our fault.
Simply the way the world works.

1415

- VINNIE: Holy shit.
- Yes, now you see.

1416
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,278
And I never said that.

1417
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,781
They're selling ratings for fees.

1418
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:07,823
A ratings shop.

1419
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,743
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1420
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:12,703
Nobody said that.

1421
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,956
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.

1422
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,390
Are you kidding me?

1423
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,833
No, I am not "kidding you".

1424
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,211
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1425
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:21,504
MARK: Is that the angle you're taking?

1426
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:25,132
So, now, anyone who has a boss
can't be held responsible

1427

No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.

And I wonder what
your incentives might be.

1431
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,812
Is it maybe in your best interest

1432
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:40,915
to have the ratings change?
Is it, perhaps?

1433
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,252
How many credit default swaps
do you own? Hmm?

1434
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,156
It doesn't make me wrong.

1435
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,366
No.

and the CDOs got more valuable.
Unbelievable.

- Unbelievable.
- We know. It's completely backwards.

1443

Bear and Deutsche $70,000.

Ben, look.

1454
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,779
Either the banks are clueless

1455
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:12,156
and they don't know
how to value these CDOs,

1456
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:17,261
or they're such crooks
that the CDOs are worth shit

How are you? Uneventful?

- Okay.

I've already been to the gym,

1568
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,380
And, yes, we had to take some losses

1569
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,758
in our subprime department last year,
but those losses

1570
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:25,486
will be contained at only 5%.

01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,763

But you know what? You seem anxious.
How can I help you?

1579
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:44,238
- Thank you. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1580
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:47,449
Would you say that it is a possibility

1581
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:52,179
or a probability that
subprime losses stop at 5%?

1582
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:53,455
Thank you.

1583
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:58,352
I would say it is a very
strong probability, indeed.

that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.

1695

But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1706
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:37,609
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1707
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,612
The banks will think we're either high
or having a stroke.

1708
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:43,048
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1709
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:46,968
Kinda brilliant.

1710
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:50,831
This is what we did
that no one else thought of.

1711
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:53,834
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1712
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,293
But we did.

1713
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,937
Little Brownhole Capital.

1714
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:02,175
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1715
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,052
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1716
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:06,446
Oh, got no angle.
We're new to this. We're just excited.

1717
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:10,283
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1718
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:11,810
I don't understand.

1719
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,538
You can buy as much
AA tranche as you want.

1720
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:18,859
$40 million against the AA.

1721
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,169
Brother, I will sell you
as much as you want.

1722
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:23,672
You understand perfectly, Bob.
You want the deal?

1723
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:25,740
(MEN LAUGHING)

1724
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,842
That's cool. That's all right with me.

1725
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:31,263
Pleasure.

1726
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:37,978
Oh! (VOCALIZING)

1727
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,398
- Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
- (CONTINUES VOCALIZING)

1728
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,316
- Stop that.
- Charlie.

1729
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,485
Stop it! Stop.

1730
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:48,989
What?

1731
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:51,783
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1732
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,852
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1733
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:55,103
We should celebrate.

1734
01:21:55,203 --> 01:21:57,105
You just bet against the American economy.

1735
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:58,690
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1736
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,734
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1737
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:03,503
Which means if we're right...

1738
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:07,908
If we're right, people lose homes.
People lose jobs.

1739
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:11,177
People lose retirement savings.
People lose pensions.

1740
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:12,454
You know what I hate
about fucking banking?

1741
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:14,080
It reduces people to numbers.
Here's a number.

1742
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:17,000
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1743
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,585
- No.
- Did you know that?

1744
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:20,270
No, I didn't know that.

1745
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,398
We were just excited.

1746
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,819
Just don't fucking dance.

1747
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,322
- CHARLIE: All right.
- JAMIE: Where are you going?

1748
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,870
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1749
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,315
First of all, great show today.

1750
01:22:40,415 --> 01:22:41,858
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

1751
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,568
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1752
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:45,378
I appreciate that.

1753
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,239
You worried you and your swaps
are getting played?

1754
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:50,450
Well, this is an opportunity for you
to meet who you're betting against.

1755
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,327
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1756
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:53,803
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1757
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:55,597
JAMIE: A real solid-gold asshole.

1758
01:22:55,764 --> 01:22:56,848
I'm a CDO manager.

1759
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:57,999
A "CDO manager"?

1760
01:22:58,099 --> 01:22:59,517
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1761
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,229
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1762
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:05,190
MR. CHAU: Oh.

1763
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,468
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1764
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:09,928
and monitor the assets.

1765
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,805
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1766
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:14,849
Do you represent the investors
or Merrill Lynch?

1767
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:15,976
The investors.

1768
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:17,102
You do.

1769
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:18,536
- Yeah.
- But...

1770
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:20,605
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

1771
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:24,250
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds
in your CDO.

1772
01:23:25,377 --> 01:23:28,088
Good question. Let's just say
Merrill and I have, um...

1773
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,799
We have a good relationship.

1774
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:33,118
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1775
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:34,869
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1776
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,430
And so the CDOs that you create

1777
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:41,459
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1778
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,461
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1779
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:47,107
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1780
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:52,237
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1781
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:56,074
Okay.

1782
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:00,829
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1783
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:02,939
They give you the bonds they want to sell.

1784
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,357
They give you clients,

1785
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:06,818
they give you money to run your business.

1786
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:08,612
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1787
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:10,714
But you represent the investors?

1788
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:11,965
(CHUCKLES)

1789
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:13,299
Is that right?

1790
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:14,451
Yeah.

1791
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:15,994
But we're not
in the Merrill Lynch building.

1792
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:17,662
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1793
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:19,831
You're 20 minutes away.

1794
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:21,850
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1795
01:24:23,727 --> 01:24:24,853
That's funny, huh?

1796
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:26,146
That's hilarious.

1797
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,398
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1798
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:30,400
Oh, boy.

1799
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,969
Your boss is about to explode.

1800
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:34,679
No, he's too curious to explode.

1801
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:36,222
Hold on. Say that again.

1802
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,433
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1803
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,435
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1804
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:42,771
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".

1805
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:44,606
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1806
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:46,791
A CDO of a CDO.

1807
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,209
All right?

1808
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:50,320
And then there's CDOs
made up of the opposite side

1809
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,963
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1810
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,507
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1811
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,785
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1812
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,595
That is fucking crazy.

1813
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,388
It's not. It's awesome.

1816
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:11,316
All right, let's say

1817

you have a pool of $50 million
in subprime loans.

1818
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:18,056
How much money could be
out there betting on it,

1819
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:20,934
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps

1820
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,602
right now, tonight?

1821
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:25,330
Let's see, $50 million... Hmm...

1822
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:27,273
A billion dollars.

1823
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:28,374
What?

JARED: If the mortgage bonds that
Michael Burry discovered were the match...

1825
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:36,658
How much bigger is the market
for insuring mortgage bonds

1826
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,218
than actual mortgages?

1827
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,553
About 20 times.

JARED: If the mortgage bonds
were the match

1829
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,583
and the CDOs were
the kerosene-soaked rags,

1830
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,711
then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb

1831
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:50,755
with the drunk President
holding his finger over the button.

1832
01:25:50,855 --> 01:25:53,091
It was at that moment
in that dumb restaurant

1833
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,344
with that stupid look on his face
that Mark Baum realized

1834
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,863
that the whole world economy
might collapse.

1835
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:04,394
And I know what you're thinking.

1836
01:26:04,494 --> 01:26:06,813
"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?"

(CROWD CHEERING)

1838
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:12,819
Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler,
father of behavioral economics

1839
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:15,547
and Selena Gomez to explain.

1840
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,033
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.

1841
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:21,995
Let's say I bet $10 million
on a blackjack hand.

1842
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:24,597
$10 million because this hand
is meant to represent

1843
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:27,225
a single mortgage bond.

1844
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:33,606
Okay, Selena has a pretty good
hand here, showing 18.

1845
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:34,716
Dealer showing seven.

1846
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,843
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1847
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:40,805
Good odds. In fact, her chances
of winning this hand are 87%.

1848
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:44,267
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1849
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:47,020
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1850
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,480
How could I lose, right?

1851
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,064
Now, this is a classic error.

1852
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:53,109
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1853
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:55,737
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.

1854
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,114
People are sure they're
gonna make the next one.

1855
01:26:58,214 --> 01:27:00,158
People think that whatever's happening now

1856
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,994
is gonna continue to
happen into the future.

1857
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,414
During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up

1858
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,166
and people thought
they would never go down.

1859
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,794
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1860
01:27:10,894 --> 01:27:12,337
will make a side bet.

1861
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:14,672
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1862
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:16,341
I love Selena Gomez.

1863
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:17,926
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1864
01:27:18,026 --> 01:27:20,094
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.

1865
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:24,015
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.

1866
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:27,435
RICHARD: Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

1867
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:28,661
on the outcome of their bet.

1868
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:29,938
Bet you 50 million she wins.

1869
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:32,982
That will lead to synthetic
CDO number two.

1870
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:36,252
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1871
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,921
wins that bet.

1872
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:41,174
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1873
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:42,425

that they could be affected.

Come on.

I left my phone in the office.
I threw my pass out already.

It's Jack. You're buying stocks?

This business kills
the part of life that is essential.

...but they choose this authority not

Well, they had to. Right?
