<font color="#80ff80">ZOOTOPIA</font>

3
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:05,117
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

4
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:07,738
Thousands of years ago
these were the...

5
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,484
forces that ruled our world

6
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,225
A world where prey were
scared of predators.

7
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,327
And predators had an
uncontrollable...

8
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:22,159
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

9
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,034
Awww!

10
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,155
Blood! Blood! Blood!

11
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,601
And.. death!

12
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,012
Ahhh...

13
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,647
Back then, the world
was divided in two.

14
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:48,818
Vicious predator,
or meek prey.

15
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:58,642
But over time, we evolved,
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

16
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:03,226
Now predator and prey
live in harmony.

17
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:07,876
And every young mammal
has multitudinous opportunities.

18
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:12,300
Yeah, I don't have to cower
in a a herd anymore.

19
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:16,109
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

20
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:23,792
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:27,020
I'm gonna be an actuary.

22
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:34,044
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...

23
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,446
A police officer!

24
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:43,220
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard!

25
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:48,826
It may seem impossible to small minds.
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

26
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:55,957
But, just 211 miles away,
stands the great city of Zootopia.

27
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,427
Where our ancestors first joined
together in peace.

28
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:05,878
And declared that anyone
can be anything!

29
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,843
Thank you and good night.

30
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,919
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

31
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,957
Nope

32
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:17,912
Well, we gave up on our dreams,
and we settled. Right, Bon?

33
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,364
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

34
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:23,466
You see, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

35
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:25,875
If you don't try anything
new, you'll never fail.

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,488
I like trying, actually.

37
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,602
What your father means, hon, is that it's
gonna be difficult, impossible even...

38
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:34,878
- for you to become a police officer.
- Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

39
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,020
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.

40
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:36,989
- Never.
- Never.

41
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:40,003
Well... Then I guess
I'll have to be the first one.

42
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:44,791
Because I am gonna make
the world a better place!

43
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,720
Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk
about making the world a better place,

44
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,786
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

45
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:55,163
Yes! Your dad, me,
your 275 brothers and sisters.

46
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:57,192
- We're changing the world.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,220
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.

48
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:02,085
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

49
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,064
You get it, honey?
I mean, it's great to have dreams.

50
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:11,474
Yeah, just as long as you
don't believe in them too much.

51
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,401
Where the heck'd she go?

52
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,140
Give me your tickets right now,
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

53
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,999
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

54
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,811
Baah, baah!
What are you gonna do, cry?

55
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:28,950
- Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
- Nice costume, loser.

56
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:33,254
What crazy world are you living in
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

57
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:37,825
- Kindly return my friend's tickets.
- Come and get them. But watch out.

58
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:41,360
Cause I'm a fox, and like you said
in your dumb little stage play,

59
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:46,191
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct's still in our denna.

60
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:50,037
- Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.
- Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

61
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:52,840
You don't scare me, Gideon.

62
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,144
Scared now?

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,333
Look at her nose twitch,
she is scared.

64
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:01,441
Cry, little baby bunny!
Cry... Ow...

65
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,490
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

66
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,602
Huh!

67
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:17,098
I want you to remember this moment
the next time you think you will ever be...

68
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,575
anything more than just a
stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

69
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,034
- That looks bad.
- Are you okay, Judy?

70
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,780
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Here you go.

71
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:36,550
- Wow, you got our tickets!
- You're awesome, Judy.

72
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,154
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talking about!

73
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:44,634
Well, he was right
about one thing.

74
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,948
I don't know when to quit.

75
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,363
<font color="#55c8ff">ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY</font>

76
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:54,893
Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city limits.

77
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,483
Tundratown, Sahara Square,
Rainforest District, to name a few.

78
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:03,173
You're gonna have to master all of
them before you hit the streets.

79
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,679
Or guess what?
You'll be dead!

80
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:09,493
Scorching sandstorm.

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,720
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.

82
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:17,030
One thousand foot fall.

83
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,493
You're dead, carrot face.

84
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:22,899
Frigid ice wall.

85
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,108
You're dead, farm girl.

86
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:28,431
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.

87
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,017
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.

88
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,387
Ohhh...!

89
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:41,147
Filthy toilet.
You're dead, fluff butt.

90
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,617
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.

91
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,722
- There's never been a bunny cop. Never.
- Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

92
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:20,620
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud
to announce that my mammal inclusion...

93
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:24,834
initiative, has produced its first
police academy graduate.

94
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:30,459
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

95
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:34,620
Judy Hopps.

96
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:38,401
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

97
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,186
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Thank you.

98
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:48,215
Judy, it is my great privilege to officially
assign you to the heart of Zootopia...

99
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,178
Precinct One.
City Center.

100
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,005
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

101
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,251
Congratulations Officer Hopps.

102
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,847
I won't let you down.

103
00:07:56,872 --> 00:07:58,729
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.

104
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:01,795
You know, it's a real proud
day for us little guys.

105
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:03,397
Bellwether, make room, will you?

106
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,717
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

107
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,359
Officer Hopps, look here.

108
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,708
- We're real proud of you, Judy.
- Yeah, and scared too.

109
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,083
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

110
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:20,990
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away, such a big city.

111
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,817
Guys, I've been working for this
my whole life.

112
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:27,654
We know. And we're just a little
exited for you, but terrified.

113
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:30,390
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.

114
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:32,676
And also bears. We have
bears to fear, too.

115
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:35,162
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves.
- Wolves?

116
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,961
- Weasels.
- You played cribbage with a weasel once?

117
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,432
Yeah, he cheats like
there's no tomorrow.

118
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:40,197
You know what?
Pretty much all predators.

119
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,169
- And Zootopia is full of them.
- Oh, Stu.

120
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,462
And foxes are the worst.

121
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,041
Yeah, actually, your father
does have a point there.

122
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,828
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

123
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:54,468
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was
a jerk who happens to be a fox.

124
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,416
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

125
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,722
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely.
But just in case,

126
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,621
we made you a little
care package to take with you.

127
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,324
- I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

128
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,226
- Yeah, it's safe to have that.
- This is fox repellant.

129
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:07,729
The deterrent and the
repellant, that's all she needs.

130
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:10,084
- Check this out!
- Oh, for goodness sake!

131
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,932
She has no need for
a fox taser, Stu.

132
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,046
Oh, come on.
When is there not a need for a fox taser?

133
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,898
Well, okay, look, I will take this...
To make you stop talking.

134
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,021
Terrific!
Everyone wins!

135
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:22,730
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

136
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,779
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!

137
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,836
Mmm. I love you, guys.

138
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,481
Love you, too.

139
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:42,929
- Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
- Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

140
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,061
Bye everybody!

141
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:50,046
Bye Judy, I love you!
Bye!

142
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:55,240
Bye!

I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.

175
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:49,358
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.
Luxury apartments with charm.

176
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:53,383
Complementary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key!

177
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:54,973
Thank you.

178
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:58,400
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor!
- Yeah? Well, we're loud.

179
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:00,926
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

180
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:06,065
Greasy walls.

181
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,967
Rickety bed.

182
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,371
Crazy neighbors.

183
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,773
I love it!

184
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:36,809
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!

185
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,005
- Excuse me!
- Hmm?

186
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,859
Down here!

187
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,923
- Hi.
- O... M... Goodness!

188
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,791
They really did hire a bunny.

189
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:51,064
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

190
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,432
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny "cute",

191
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:59,210
but when other animals
do it, that's a little...

192
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:03,911
Ohhh. I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

193
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:08,415
The guy everyone thinks is just
a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

194
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,206
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.

195
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,732
Oh. You've actually got...
there's a...

196
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:15,085
- A what?
- In your neck. The fold.

197
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,393
- The... this...
- Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

198
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,861
Hehehe, I should get to roll call,
so which way do I...

199
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:26,159
- Oh, ball pen's over there to the left.
- Great. Thank you!

200
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,756
Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna
get eaten alive.

201
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,881
Hey! Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?

202
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,517
Attention!

203
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,223
All right. All right.
Everybody sit.

204
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,361
I've got three items
on the docket.

205
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:07,932
First, we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

206
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,762
Francine.
Happy birthday.

207
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:14,582
Oh.

208
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,384
Number two. There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce,

209
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,146
but I'm not going to because...
I don't care.

210
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:27,186
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

211
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:31,790
All predators. From a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

212
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,594
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.

213
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:40,399
This is priority number one.
Assignments.

214
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,849
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.

215
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:46,542
Your team take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

216
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:51,786
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.

217
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:56,681
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.

218
00:15:56,716 --> 00:16:02,455
And finally, our first bunny,
Officer Hopps.

219
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,948
Parking duty.
Dismissed.

220
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,350
Parking duty?

221
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,958
Chief?
Chief Bogo?

222
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,968
Sir. You said there were
fourteen missing mammal cases.

223
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:18,010
- So?
- So I can handle one.

224
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:21,378
You probably forgot but, I was
top of my class at the academy.

225
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,041
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.

226
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,020
Sir, I'm not just
some token bunny.

227
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:29,385
Well then, writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

228
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:36,279
A 100 tickets. I'm not
gonna write 100 tickets.

229
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:40,453
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.

230
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,157
<font color="#ff8080">FREQUENT STOPS</font>

231

232
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,418

233
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:29,175
Ah!

234
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:41,218
Boom!
Two hundred tickets before noon!

235
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,858
201.

236
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,228
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

237
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,629
Huh!

238
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,290
Hmm.

239
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,269
Where'd he go?

240
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:38,693
Listen. I know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours,

241
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:42,338
but I don't want any
trouble in here. So hit the road!

242
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:44,826
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir...

243
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:49,944
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop.
For my little boy.

244
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,960
You want the red,
or the blue, pal?

245
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:02,524
Oh.
I'm such a...

246
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,084
- Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy.
- What?

247
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:08,182
There aren't any fox ice cream joints
in your part of town?

248
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,963
No, no. There are, there are.
It's just, my boy,

249
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,646
this goofy little stinker,
he loves all things elephant.

250
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:17,074
He wants to be one
when he grows up.

251
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,307
Isn't that adorable?

252
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:22,913
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?

253
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:26,238
Look, you probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says

254
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:31,972
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!
So beat it.

255
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:34,495
You're holding up the line.

256
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,375
Hello.
Excuse me.

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,739
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, meter maid.

258
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,840
Actually, I'm an officer.

259
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,594
Just have a quick question.

260
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,833
Are your customers
aware they're getting

261
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,515
snot and mucus with
their cookies and cream?

262
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,184
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,778
Well. I don't wanna
cause you any trouble,

264
00:19:55,803 --> 00:20:00,762
but I believe scooping ice cream with an
ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

265
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,104
Which is kind of a big deal.

266
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,993
Of course I could let you off with
a warning if you were to glove those trunks

267
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:10,401
and... I don't know...
finish selling this...

268
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:14,141
nice dad and his son a...
What was it?

269
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,696
A Jumbo-Pop.
Please.

270
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,155
A Jumbo-Pop.

271
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,381
- $15.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

272
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,584
Oh no, are you kidding me...

273
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:29,716
I don't have my wallet!

274
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:32,132
I'd lose my head if it
weren't attached to my neck.

275
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:35,164
That's the truth. Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.

276
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,299
Gotta be about the
worst birthday ever.

277
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:41,681
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.

278
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,989
Keep the change.

279
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,746
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

280
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,370
Oh, no.
My treat.

281
00:20:55,395 --> 00:21:00,163
It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks
with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

282
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:06,020
I just want to say you're a great
dad and just a real articulate fella.

283
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,129
Oh.
Well, that is high praise.

284
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:11,229
It's rare that I find
someone so non-patronizing.

285
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,565
- Officer?
- Hopps. Mr..?

286
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,728
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.

287
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:19,354
And you, little guy. You wanna
be an elephant when you grow up?

288
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,476
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.

289
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:26,267
Anyone can be anything.

290
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,587
Ahh.
I tell him that all the time.

291
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:30,594
All right, here you go.
Two paws.

292
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:34,886
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile,
that's a happy birthday smile!

293
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:37,963
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

294
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:39,764
Toot-toot.

295
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,564
- Bye, now!
- Goodbye!

296
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,128
Oh.

Ciao.

308
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:44,933
Well, I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

309
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,153
You liar!

310
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:50,863
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar. He is.

311
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:55,157
Hey!

312
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:57,546
All right, Slick-Nick.
You're under arrest.

313
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,261
Really?
For what?

314
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,777
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit?

315
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,932
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines?

316
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,803
- False advertizing.
- Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

317
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:10,411
And I didn't falsely
advertize anything. Take care.

318
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,708
You told that mouse the
Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

319
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:15,544
That's right. Red wood.
With a space in the middle.

320
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:17,473
Wood that is red.

321
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:21,083
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

322
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,209
You're gonna wanna refrain
from calling me Carrots.

323
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:25,253
My bad. I just naturally
assumed you came...

324
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:27,526
from some little carrot-choked Podunk.
No?

325
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,159
Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

326
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,659
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

327
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,723
Naive little hick with good
grades and big ideas decides

328
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:40,147
"Hey, look at me, I'm
gonna move to Zootopia...

329
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:43,638
Where predators and prey live
in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

330
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:46,744
Only to find, whoopsie,
we don't all get along.

331
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:50,855
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

332
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,723
And whoopsie number three-sie,
no one cares about her or her dreams.

333
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:58,957
And soon enough those dreams die, and our
bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

334
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:02,828
living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go
back home

335
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:06,337
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become...

336
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:10,460
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer?

337
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,838
That sound about right?

338
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,714
Oh!

339
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,165
Be careful now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

340
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,477
Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can
or can't be. Especially not some...

341
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:29,627
jerk who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

342
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,344
All right, look.

343
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:35,374
Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking
they can be anything they want.

344
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,954
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.

345
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,505
Sly fox.
Dumb bunny.

346
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,155
I'm not a dumb bunny.

347
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,829
Right.
And that's not wet cement.

348
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,161
You'll never be a real cop.

349
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,988
You're a cute meter maid, though.

350
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:56,868
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.

CARROTS for ONE

356

Mom & Dad

357
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:53,535
- Oh, hey, it's my parents!
- Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

358
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:56,605
Hey there, Jude the Dude.
How was your first day on the force?

359
00:26:56,606 --> 00:27:00,859
- It was real great!
- Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

360
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:06,415
Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

361
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,117
- I'm really making a difference.
- Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

362
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:10,952
- Look at that!
- Oh, my sweet heaven!

363
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,856
Judy, are you a meter maid?

364
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,490
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing..

365
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:18,561
- It's the safest job on the force!
- She's not a real cop!

366
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:20,862
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Glorious day!

367
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,157
Ho-ho, meter maid,
meter maid, meter maid!

368
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,166
- Dad! Dad!
- Meter maid!

369
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,102
You know what,
it's been a really long day, I should...

370
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,904
- You get some rest.
- Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

371
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:33,707
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

372
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,115
Hey, bunny!
Turn down that depressing music!

373
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,386
Leave the meter maid alone,
didn't you hear her conversation?

374
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:46,688
- She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!

375
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,089
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

376
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,926
- You shut up!
- Tomorrow is another day.

377
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:54,457
Yeah, but it might be worse!

378
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,946
I was 30 seconds over!

379
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:02,363
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.

380
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,299
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.

381
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:10,795
Uncool rabbit, my tax dollars
pay your salary.

382
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:16,851
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

383
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:18,169
Hey, you!
Bunny!

384
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:22,273
Sir, if you have a grievance you may
contest recitation in traffic court.

385
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,329
What are you talking about?!
My shop!

386
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:27,695
It was just robbed!
Look, he's getting away!

387
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,302
Well, are you a cop or not?

388
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:33,039
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Don't worry, sir, I got this!

389
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:42,037
- Stop in the name of the law!
- Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!

390
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:50,414
Coming through!

391
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,506
This is officer McHorn.
We got a 10-31.

392
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:55,862
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!

393
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,809
Woo-hoo!

394
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:02,772
<font color="#ff8080">LITTLE
RODENTIA</font>

395
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:06,050
- Ah!
- Ahh!

396
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,890
Ha ha ha.

397
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:13,952
You!
Hey!

398
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:17,311
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!

399
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:19,745
Stop!

400
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,110
Ahhhh!

401
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:45,624
Oh.

402
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:50,544
Sorry! Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

403
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:53,863
Yahhh!

404
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,368
Bon voyage, flatfoot!

405
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,620
Huh!

406
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:17,775
- Hey! Stop right there!
- Have a donut, coppa!

407
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:21,797
Oh my god, did you see those
leopard print jeggings?

408
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,287
- Ah!
- Ah!

409
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,221
Oh!

410
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,147
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.

411
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,047
Heheheheh.
Come to papa!

412
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,718
Okay. You're gonna have
to be patient and wait in line

413
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:41,852
just like everyone else,
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

414
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:52,439
- I popped the weasel!
- Hopps!

415
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:59,847
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents...

416
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:05,319
But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

417
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,789
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

418
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,316
Those are a crocus variety called
<i>midnicampum holicithias.</i>

419
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,960
They're a class C botanical, sir.

420
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:15,572
Well, I grew up in a family where plant
husbandry was kind of a thing...

421
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:19,928
- Shut your tiny mouth now!
- Sir, I got the bad guy.

422
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:21,253
That's my job.

423
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,746
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!

424
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:27,757
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's
here to see you again.

425
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,810
- Not now.
- Okay, I just need to know if you want to...

426
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:32,146
- take it this time she seems really upset...
- Not now!

427
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:34,330
Sir. I don't wanna
be a meter maid,

428
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,891
I wanna be a real cop.

429
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:39,748
Do you think the mayor
asked what I wanted...

430
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,147
- when he assigned you to me?
- But, sir...

431
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:47,368
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you
sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...

432
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:53,067
magically come true!
So let it go.

433
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:56,495
Chief Bogo, please!
Five minutes of your time, please.

434
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,517
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her,
she's super slippery.

435
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,042
I gotta go sit down.

436
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:05,179
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

437
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,656
My husband has been
missing for ten days.

438
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:10,185
- His name is Emmitt Otterton.
- Yes. I know.

439
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,291
He's a florist.
We have 2 beautiful children.

440
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:16,290
He would never just disappear.

441
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,183
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.

442
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,963
Please. There's gotta be somebody
to find my Emmitt.

443
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,937
- Mrs. Otterton.
- I will find him.

444
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:32,306
Oh. Thank you!
Bless you, bless you, little bunny!

445
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:37,390
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.

446
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:40,851
Bring him home to me and my babies.
Please.

447
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:43,025
Mrs. Otterton.
Please wait out here.

448
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,175
Of course.
Oh, thank you both so much!

449
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,606
One second.

450
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,684
- You're fired.
- What? Why?

451
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:55,507
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open
this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter

452
00:32:55,532 --> 00:33:01,635
you're a former meter maid with delusion
of grandeur, who will not be taking the case.

453
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:04,304
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case!

454
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:05,855
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!

455
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,265
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

456
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,678
Mayor Lionheart is
just gonna be so jazzed!

457
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,850
No, let's not tell
the mayor just yet.

458
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,178
And I sent it, and it is done,
so I did do that.

459
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,476
All right, well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.

460
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:21,205
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

461
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,654
- Like glue.
- Good one.

462
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,974
Just call me if you ever
need anything. Okay?

463
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:29,549
You've always got a friend at
City Hall, Judy. All right! Bye-bye!

464
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,154
Thank you, ma'am!

465
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,585
I will give you 48 hours.

466
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,542
Yes!

467
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:47,413
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
But.. You strike out, you resign.

468
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,990
Okay. Deal.

469
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:57,079
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

470
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:00,927
Here you go.
One missing otter.

471
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,613
- That's it?
- Yikes!

472
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:06,762
That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen. Leads, none.

473
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:09,899
Witnesses, none. And you're not in the
computer system yet, so...

474
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,293
Resources, none!
Ha ha!

475
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:16,883
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your
career on cracking this one.

476
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,941
Okay.
Last known sighting.

477
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,791
Can I just borrow?
Thank you.

478
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,653
- Pawpsicle?
- The murder weapon!

479
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:35,537
- "Get your Pawpsicle"...
- Yeah! Cause that...

480
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:37,546
 What does that mean?

481
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:42,355
It means I have a lead.

482
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:51,510
- Hi! Hello! It's me again!
- Hey! It's officer toot-toot.

483
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:54,204
Hoo...No.
Actually it's Officer Hopps,

484
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:56,761
and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

485
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:59,628
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

486
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:01,600
It wasn't me.

487
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:06,742
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.

488
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:11,380
This is important, sir. I think your
ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait.

489
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:14,920
Ha! I make 200 bucks
a day, fluff.

490
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:18,389
365 days a year,
since I was 12.

491
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:21,465
- And time is money. Hop along.
- Please just look at the picture.

492
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,062
You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right?

493
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,165
- Do you know him?
- I know everybody.

494
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,006
And I also know that somewhere

495
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:31,856
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,
so why don't you get back to your box?

496
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:35,394
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

497
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:39,969
- Did you just boot my stroller?
- Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

498
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:42,577
Ha. For what? Hurting
your feelings?

499
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:44,527
Felony tax evasion.

500
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:49,258
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12...

501
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:54,853
that's two decades, so times twenty, which is
1,460,000, I think.

502
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:58,371
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

503
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:03,429
Anyway, according to your tax forms,
you reported, let me see here, zero!

504
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:07,887
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

505
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:11,997
- 5 years jail time.
- Well, it's my word against yours.

506
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:17,328
<i>200 bucks a day, fluff,
365 days a year, since I was twelve.</i>

507
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:19,241
Actually it's your
word against yours.

508
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:20,970
And if you want this pen
you're going to help me

509
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:23,417
find this poor missing otter,
or the only place

510
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:26,963
you'll be selling Pawpsicles
is the prison cafeteria.

511
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:29,971
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

512
00:36:29,996 --> 00:36:35,312
She hustled you.
Ehahaha...

513
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:39,808
She hustled you good!
You're a cop now, Nick.

514
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:42,558
You're gonna need one of these.

515
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,954
Have fun working with the fuzz!

516
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:49,266
Start talking.

517
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:53,086
I don't know where he is,
I only saw where he went.

518
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,518
Great, let's go!

519
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:59,187
It's not exactly a place
for a cute little bunny.

520
00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:03,984
- Don't call me cute, get in the car.
- Okay. You're the boss.

521
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:25,037
Hi.
I'm...

522
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:30,979
Hello? Hello?
Hello?

523
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,757
Hello!
My name is...

524
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:37,744
You know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there.

525
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,358
Cause we're all good on
bunny scout cookies.

526
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,688
Uh, no.

527
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:47,022
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

528
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:51,830
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.
He may have frequented this establishment?

529
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah, old Emmitt!

530
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:01,471
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.

531
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:06,346
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.

532
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:09,388
Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate
that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

533
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:14,627
- Oh! You are naked..
- Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

534
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:20,159
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.

535
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,579
Nangi's just on the other side
of the pleasure pool.

536
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:37,445
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

537
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:39,706
Yes, there is.

538
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:42,017
Boy, that's the spirit.

539
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:48,463
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.
But you know what I say is weird?

540
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:52,872
Clothes on animals!
Here we go!

541
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:57,544
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

542
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:02,322
Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

543
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:03,702
- Who?
- Eh.

544
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:07,966
Emmitt Otterton. Been coming
to your yoga class for like six years.

545
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:09,640
I have no memory
of this beaver.

546
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,325
He's an otter, actually.

547
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,679
He was here a couple of
Wednesdays ago. Remember?

548
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,625
No.

549
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,694
Yeah, he was wearing a green
cable knit sweater vest,

550
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:23,821
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

551
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:26,568
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

552
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:32,089
Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this
big old white car with a silver trim.

553
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:36,311
Needed a tune up. The third cylinder
wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

554
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:37,410
No.

555
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:41,403
Eh. You didn't happen to catch
the licence plate number?

556
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:48,225
- Did you?
- Oh, for sure. It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

557
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,882
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info.
Thank you.

558
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:58,256
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

559
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:05,206
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

560
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:08,385
I will take that pen
and bid you adieu.

561
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,409
The plate.
I can't run a plate.

562
00:40:10,435 --> 00:40:12,805
Oomf.
I'm not in the system yet.

563
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:16,842
- Give me the pen, please.
- What was it you said?

564
00:40:16,843 --> 00:40:18,830
Any moron can run a plate?

565
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:23,276
Gosh, if only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

566
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,959
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

567
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,014
You can't keep me
on the hook forever.

568
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,567
Not forever. Well, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case.

569
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:34,534
So can you run the plate or not?

570
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:40,398
Actually, I just remembered,
I have a pal at the DMV.

571
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:43,468
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
You need something done, he's on it.

572
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:47,395
I hope so. We are really fighting the clock
and every minute counts.

573
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,632
Wait.
They're all sloths?

574
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,206
You said this was
going to be quick!

575
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,014
What, are you saying just
because he's a sloth

576
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,145
he can't be fast? I thought in
Zootopia anyone could be anything.

577
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:31,550
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

578
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:37,804
Nice to... see you... too.

579
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,073
Hey, Flash, I'd love
you to meet my friend.

580
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,918
Ah...Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

581
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:45,749
Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are you?

582
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,597
I am...

583
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:51,150
doing... just..

584
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:57,209
- Fine?
- as well.. as..  I can.. be...

585
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,643
- What...
- Hang in there.

586
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:02,114
- can I... do...
- Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

587
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:04,516
- for you...
- Well, I was hoping you could...

588
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,433
...today?

589
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:14,054
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.

590
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,297
- Sure... What's the... plate...
- 2-9-T...

591
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:24,751
- Number?
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

592
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:39,416
- 2... 9...
- T-H-D-0-3.

593
00:42:40,386 --> 00:42:44,088
- T...
- H-D-0-3.

594
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:48,025
- H...
- D-0-3.

595
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,860
- D...
- Mm-hm. 0-3.

596
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:57,314
- 0...
- 3!

597
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,140
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke?
- No!

598
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,390
- Sure.
- Mmm!

599
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,093
What do you call a
three-humped camel?

600
00:43:08,648 --> 00:43:15,754
I don't know.
What do you call...

601
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:21,192
-  Three-humped camel.
- a three-humped... camel?

602
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:24,398
Pregnant.
Ha ha ha ha...

603
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:40,779
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!
Can we please just focus on the task?

604
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,247
- Hey...
- Wait, wait!

605
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:45,816
- Priscilla!
- Oh, no!

606
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:51,330
- Yes... Flash?
- What... do..

607
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:52,724
- No...
- you call...

608
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:54,092
A three-humped camel?

609
00:43:54,093 --> 00:43:58,762
- Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just...
- - three... humped...

610
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:13,351
- Here... you...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!

611
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:15,138
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- ...go.

612
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:18,070
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

613
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:20,537
A limo took Otterton! And
the limo's in Tundratown!

614
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:21,819
It's in Tundratown!

615
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:23,655
Way to hustle, bud. I love you.
I owe you.

616
00:44:23,656 --> 00:44:27,300
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...
It's night?!

617
00:44:28,594 --> 00:44:30,178
Closed.
Great.

618
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:34,277
Mm. And I will betcha
you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

619
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:38,212
- Darn it. It's a bummer.
- You wasted the day on purpose.

620
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:42,640
Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never
impede your pretend investigation.

621
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:48,526
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

622
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:51,122
Well, then they should have
gotten a real cop to find him.

623
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,864
What is your problem? Does
seeing me fail somehow make

624
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:56,637
you feel better about your
own sad, miserable life?

625
00:44:56,638 --> 00:44:58,817
It does, 100%.

626
00:44:58,842 --> 00:45:05,162
Now, since you're sans warrant.
I guess we're done?

627
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:10,361
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

628
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:19,210
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.

629
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:22,113
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.

630
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:25,783
- I wish I could have helped more.
- The thing is, you don't need...

631
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,395
a warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

632
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,391
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty! Come on!

633
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,563
2-9-T-H-D-0-3!
This is it!

634
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,900
Polar bear fur.

635
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,744
- Oh my God!
- What? What?

636
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:56,339
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

637
00:45:57,482 --> 00:46:01,054
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?

638
00:46:06,124 --> 00:46:10,831
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

639
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:17,268
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?

640
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:19,924
- No.
- Oh, wait. Look!

641
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:26,505
This is him. Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.

642
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:29,376
What do you think happened?

643
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,329
Oh no, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur...

644
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:39,390
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

645
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:42,407
- What? Whose car is it?
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

646
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:46,163
They call him Mr. Big, and he does not
like me. So we gotta go!

647
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:48,076
I'm not leaving,
this is a crime scene.

648
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:49,589
Well, it's gonna be an
even bigger crime scene...

649
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:52,955
if Mr. Big finds me here,
so we're leaving right now.

650
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:57,742
Raymond! And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

651
00:46:57,743 --> 00:47:01,839
And speaking of no see,
how about you forget you saw me?

652
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,816
Huh?
For old times sake?

653
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:05,681
That's a no..

654
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,365
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

655
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:24,938
I, uh... I may have sold him
a very expensive wall rug

656
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:31,545
that was made from the fur
of a skunk's butt.

657
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:35,166
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

658
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:51,372
- Is that Mr. Big?
- No.

659
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:55,365
- What about him? Is that him?
- No.

660
00:47:57,502 --> 00:48:01,138
- That's gotta be him.
- Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking!

661
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:09,489
Huh.

662
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:11,953
Mr. Big, sir,
this is a simple misunder...

663
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:13,234
Hmmph.

664
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:14,497
Yeah.

665
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:19,323
This is a simple misunderstanding.

666
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:23,220
You come here unannounced on the
day my daughter is to be married.

667
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,385
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

668
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,625
Point is, I did not know
that it was your car,

669
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,059
and I certainly did not know about
your daughter's wedding!

670
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:35,572
I trusted you, Nicky.

671
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,608
I welcomed you into my home.

672
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:39,543
We broke bread together.

673
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:42,112
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

674
00:48:42,113 --> 00:48:44,824
And how did you repay my generosity?

675
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:48,986
With a rug
made from the butt of a skunk.

676
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:50,954
A skunk-butt rug.

677
00:48:50,955 --> 00:48:52,656
You disrespected me.

678
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:54,658
You disrespected my grandmama,

679
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,926
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

680
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,966
I told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are.

681
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:05,502
Snooping around with this...

682
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:08,138
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?

683
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:10,240
- Sir, I am a co...
- Mime!

684
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,419
She's a mime.
This mime can not speak.

685
00:49:13,444 --> 00:49:15,979
- You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.

686
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,350
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car!

687
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:24,271
So intimidate me all you want,
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

688
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:27,576
if it's the last thing I do.

689
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,849
Hmm.
Then I have only one request.

690
00:49:31,996 --> 00:49:34,574
Say hello to Grandmama.

691
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:35,966
Ice 'em!

692
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:38,635
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

693
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:39,736
And you never will.

694
00:49:39,737 --> 00:49:41,909
Please!
No, no, no, no!

695
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:44,174
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!

696
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:48,696
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

697
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:53,584
Ah! What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!

698
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:56,353
I have to, baby,
daddy has to.

699
00:49:56,354 --> 00:49:58,119
- Ice 'em.
- No, no, no!

700
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:59,823
Wait, wait!

701
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:04,536
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut!

702
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:07,351
- This bunny?
- Yeah. Hi!

703
00:50:07,376 --> 00:50:12,003
- Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.

704
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,120
Put them down.

705
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,731
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.

706
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:25,306
I will take your kindness,
and pay it forward.

707
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:45,698
Hmm.

708
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:58,335
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.

709
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:01,367
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

710
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,942
That's why I sent that
car to pick him up.

711
00:51:05,223 --> 00:51:07,457
But he never arrived.

712
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,925
Because he was attacked.

713
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:11,794
No, he attacked.

714
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:13,363
Otterton?

715
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,698
Otterton.

716
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:17,953
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car.

717
00:51:17,978 --> 00:51:23,284
Scared my driver half to death.
And disappeared into the night.

718
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:26,211
But he's a sweet little otter.

719
00:51:27,478 --> 00:51:35,034
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down we are still animals.

720
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:39,697
You wanna find Otterton, talk to
the driver of the car.

721
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:44,261
His name is Manchas.
Lives in the Rainforest District.

722
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:47,007
Only he can tell you more.

723
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:52,302
Mr. Manchas?

724
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:54,270
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

725
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:58,107
We just wanna know what happened
to Emmitt Otterton.

726
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:07,609
You should be asking
what happened to me.

727
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:13,332
- Whoa. A teensy otter did that?
- What happened?

728
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:16,060
He was an animal.

729
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:20,210
Down on all fours.

730
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:25,753
He was a savage!

731
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:39,916
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

732
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:42,919
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

733
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,732
So you know about
the Night Howlers too?

734
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:50,370
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly

735
00:52:50,395 --> 00:52:53,337
what we are here
to talk about. Right?

736
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:58,394
Yes, so you just open the
door and tell us what you know,

737
00:52:58,419 --> 00:53:00,546
and we will tell you what we know.

738
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:02,067
Okay?

739
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:04,552
Okay.

740
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:07,870
Clever fox.

741
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:14,372
Mr. Manchas?

742
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:21,744
Are you okay?

743
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:26,286
Run. Run!

744
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:33,569
- What is wrong with him?!
- I don't know!

745
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:39,543
Jump!

746
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:43,249
Come on!

747
00:53:47,764 --> 00:53:49,316
Head down!

748
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:52,522
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

749
00:53:52,523 --> 00:53:55,966
Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest
singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

750
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:57,422
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.

751
00:53:57,447 --> 00:53:59,162
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?

752
00:53:59,163 --> 00:54:03,462
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

753
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:07,606
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

754
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:09,328
It's not, it's just a new app.

755
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,564
- Hold on a second.
- Clawhauser!

756
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:12,727
Clawhauser, listen to me.

757
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:15,489
We have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

758
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:18,381
- Vine and Tujunga!
- It's Tu-hunga!

759
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:21,316
Okay, we're sending backup!

760
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,804
Look, over there!
Head for the sky-trans!

761
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:38,901
Get in.
Carrots? Carrots!

762
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,133
Go!

763
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:47,075
Buddy, one predator to another.

764
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,865
Now I can tell you're a little tense,
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

765
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:04,102
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

766
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:06,003
- I'm gonna let go!
- You're gonna to what?

767
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,652
One, two...

768
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:17,784
Carrots, you saved my life.

769
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:22,471
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...
Awww...

770
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:40,729
Well, this should be good.

771
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:44,967
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,
but it's way bigger.

772
00:55:44,968 --> 00:55:47,336
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

773
00:55:47,337 --> 00:55:50,272
I believe he and this jaguar,
they...

774
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:51,600
They went savage, sir.

775
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:56,012
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.
Animals don't go savage.

776
00:55:56,013 --> 00:55:58,047
I thought so too.

777
00:55:58,048 --> 00:56:00,548
Till I saw this.

778
00:56:01,718 --> 00:56:03,019
What?

779
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,451
He was right here!

780
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:06,756
The savage jaguar?

781
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:09,191
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

782
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:14,881
Or maybe any agressive predator
looks savage to rabbits?

783
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:15,929
Let's go!

784
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:16,966
Wait! Sir!

785
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,467
I'm not the only one who saw him.

786
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:23,064
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

787
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,517
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

788
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:28,631
Two days to find the otter,
or you quit.

789
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:31,423
That was the deal.

790
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:33,742
Badge.

791
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,594
- But, sir, we had...
- Badge!

792
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,603
Uh, no.

793
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:53,535
- What did you say, fox?
- Sorry, what I said was "no...".

794
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,060
She will not be giving you that badge.

795
00:56:56,173 --> 00:57:00,237
Look, you gave her a clown vest,
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

796
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:04,380
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

797
00:57:04,381 --> 00:57:06,849
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.

798
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,310
None of you guys were gonna help her,
were you?

799
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:10,774
Here's the thing, chief.

800
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,513
You gave her the 48 hours,
so technically we still have...

801
00:57:14,538 --> 00:57:18,294
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

802
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:23,933
So if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

803
00:57:23,934 --> 00:57:25,770
Good day.

804
00:57:31,341 --> 00:57:33,448
Officer Hopps.

805
00:57:54,964 --> 00:57:56,562
Thank you.

806
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,289
Never let them see that they get to you.

807
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,771
So...

808
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:05,374
Things do get to you?

809
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,905
I mean not, not anymore.

810
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:12,415
But I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

811
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:15,645
- Har har.
- No, it's true.

812
00:58:15,664 --> 00:58:19,501
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

813
00:58:18,535 --> 00:58:23,992
And all I wanted to do was join
the Junior Ranger Scouts.

814
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:28,620
So my mom scaped together enough money
to buy me a brand new uniform.

815
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:31,592
Because, by god, I
was gonna fit in.

816
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:36,565
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop, the only fox.

817
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,020
I was gonna be part of a pack.

818
00:58:39,045 --> 00:58:42,422
- Ready for initiation?
- Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

819
00:58:42,447 --> 00:58:44,516
I was so proud.

820
00:58:46,517 --> 00:58:47,309
Okay. Now raise your right
paw, and deliver the oath.

821
00:58:49,334 --> 00:58:56,262
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

822
00:58:58,287 --> 00:59:01,856
Even though you're a fox?

823
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,852
What?

824
00:59:04,943 --> 00:59:07,747
No, no! What did I
do wrong, you guys?

825
00:59:07,772 --> 00:59:12,207
No, please! What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

826
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:16,184
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle?

827
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:18,972
You're even dumber than you look.

828
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:23,246
Is he gonna cry?

829
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:41,264
I learned two things that day.

830
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,101
One:

831
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:46,807
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.

832
00:59:47,773 --> 00:59:50,242
And two?

833
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:55,547
If the world's only gonna see
a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

834
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:58,717
There's no point in trying
to be anything else.

835
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:02,863
Nick, you are so much more than that.

836
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,383
Boy, look at that
traffic down there.

837
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:10,048
How about we go up to
Chuck in traffic central?

838
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,974
Chuck, how are things looking
on the jam cams?

839
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:15,499
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

840
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:17,769
The jam cams...

841
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,071
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, no no!

842
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:25,210
There are traffic cameras everywhere.
All over the canopy!

843
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:28,381
- Whatever happened to that jaguar...
- The traffic cameras would have caught it!

844
01:00:28,406 --> 01:00:31,349
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

845
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:35,057
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before,

846
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:38,591
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is
gonna let you into it now.

847
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:43,258
No. But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

848
01:00:43,996 --> 01:00:47,211
Eh. Sir, if we could just review
these very important billings.

849
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:49,577
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir.

850
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:53,304
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,
just take care of it!

851
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:55,902
Please.
And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

852
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:57,772
Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do
have a meeting with

853
01:00:57,797 --> 01:01:00,645
Herds and Gradings.
Sir, that's just, oh...

854
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,180
Oh, mutton chops.

855
01:01:05,284 --> 01:01:08,552
Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
we need your help.

856
01:01:08,484 --> 01:01:09,952
OFFICE OF THE
ASSISTANT
MAYOR
(PLEASE KNOCK!)

857
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,683
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

858
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:22,516
- So fluffy!
- Hey!

859
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:26,447
- Sheep never let me get this close!
- You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

860
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,424
- It's like cotton candy.
- Stop it!

861
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:29,974
Where to?

862
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,934
Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict.
Vine and Tujunga.

863
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:35,313
There.
Traffic cams for the whole city.

864
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:37,420
This is so exiting actually.
I mean, well, you know.

865
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:39,517
I never get to do
anything this important.

866
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:41,686
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

867
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:44,455
Oh.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

868
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,967
I think Mayor Lionheart just
wanted the sheep vote.

869
01:01:46,992 --> 01:01:48,744
But he did give me that nice mug.

870
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:50,408
WORLD'S GREATEST
ASSISTANT MAYOR (Written with marker)
DAD (Crossed out)

871
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,463
Feels good to be appreciated.

872
01:01:52,488 --> 01:01:53,609
Smellwether!

873
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:56,744
Ah.
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

874
01:01:56,769 --> 01:02:00,061
I called him Lionfart once,
he did not care for that.

875
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:01,547
Let me tell you, it was
not a good day for me.

876
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:03,954
- Yes, sir.
- I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

877
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:07,450
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.

878
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,923
It was really nice for me to be...

879
01:02:09,948 --> 01:02:12,448
While we're young, Smellwether.

880
01:02:13,986 --> 01:02:16,018
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?

881
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:18,128
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams..

882
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:19,760
Tujunga.... Tujunga....

883
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:21,451
We're in.

884
01:02:26,732 --> 01:02:31,511
- Who are these guys?
- Eh. Timberwolves.

885
01:02:31,536 --> 01:02:34,036
Look at these dum-dums.

886
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:36,905
Huh!

887
01:02:37,142 --> 01:02:39,811
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

888
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:40,812
And there it is.

889
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:44,338
I mean, what is it with wolves
and the howling, it's...?

890
01:02:44,363 --> 01:02:46,434
Howlings!
Night Howlers!

891
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:50,311
That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers!

892
01:02:50,336 --> 01:02:53,312
- If they took Manchas..
- I bet they took Otterton too.

893
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:56,197
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.

894
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:04,108
Wait, where'd they go?

895
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:08,227
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal,

896
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:11,343
which I never have, I would use the
maintenance tunnel 6B.

897
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:14,945
Which would put them out...
right there.

898
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:18,558
Well, look at you, junior detective.

899
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:22,920
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

900
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:25,056
Eh. How dare you.

901
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:27,653
Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass.

902
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,826
South canyon.

903
01:03:28,827 --> 01:03:30,795
Mm-hm.
They're heading out of town.

904
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:33,324
Where does that road go?

905
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:37,376
<font color="#80bfff">[ CLIFFSIDE ]</font>

906
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:19,276
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl!

907
01:04:19,277 --> 01:04:21,171
I didn't start it.

908
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:29,478
Come on.

909
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:39,866
You are a clever bunny.

910
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,339
It looks like this was a hospital.

911
01:05:11,596 --> 01:05:14,096
You know, after you,
you're the cop.

912
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:24,068
Okay, all clear.

913
01:05:27,812 --> 01:05:31,815
Ha.
All this equipment is brand new.

914
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:34,780
Carrots.

915
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:37,893
Claw marks.

916
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:41,522
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
What kind of...

917
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,244
Mr. Manchas.

918
01:06:11,856 --> 01:06:15,124
It's him!
We found our otter.

919
01:06:15,627 --> 01:06:18,896
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

920
01:06:18,897 --> 01:06:20,831
Your wife sent me to find you.

921
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:22,974
We're gonna get you out of here now.

922
01:06:23,568 --> 01:06:25,169
Or not.

923
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,805
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

924
01:06:27,806 --> 01:06:30,172
11, 12, 13, 14.

925
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:33,366
Not including Manchas,
it's... it's fourteen.

926
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:36,370
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

927
01:06:36,395 --> 01:06:37,781
They're all here...

928
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:41,805
All the missing mammals are right here.
Huh!

929
01:06:46,578 --> 01:06:47,887
Enough!

930
01:06:47,912 --> 01:06:50,566
I don't want excuses, doctor,
I want answers.

931
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:53,902
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.

932
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,003
Really?

933
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:58,566
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here
who've gone off the rails crazy,

934
01:06:58,591 --> 01:07:00,537
And you can't tell me why.

935
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:03,316
Now I'd call that awfully far
from doing everything!

936
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:06,553
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

937
01:07:06,578 --> 01:07:08,578
What?
What do you mean "biology"?

938
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:11,340
The only animals going savage are predators.

939
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:14,945
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

940
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,450
Hm, great idea.
Tell the public.

941
01:07:17,475 --> 01:07:22,502
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor who is a lion?!

942
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:25,247
- I'll be ruined!
- Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

943
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:31,404
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we
are going to keep it that way.

944
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:32,630
Oh, no!

945
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:35,273
- Someone's here.
- Sir, you need to go. Now.

946
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:37,692
Security, sweep the area.

947
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:46,550
Great, we're dead.

948
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:49,786
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead.
You're dead. Everybody's dead.

949
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:51,061
- Can you swim?
- What?

950
01:07:51,086 --> 01:07:54,427
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

951
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:04,152
Aaahhhh!

952
01:08:13,692 --> 01:08:17,888
Carrots!
Hopps! Judy!

953
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,555
We gotta tell Bogo!

954
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:25,822
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

955
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,568
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now.

956
01:08:29,593 --> 01:08:31,794
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No!

957
01:08:31,795 --> 01:08:34,913
I'm Gazelle, and you
are one hot dancer.

958
01:08:34,938 --> 01:08:39,324
You have the app too?
Ooohhh...  Chief!

959
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:42,410
Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

960
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:44,503
Oh! Yes, of course.
About that, sir.

961
01:08:44,528 --> 01:08:47,853
Officer Hopps just called,
she found all of them.

962
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:50,378
Wow, I'm impressed.

963
01:08:52,936 --> 01:08:55,335
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you...

964
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,457
You don't understand,
I was trying to protect the city!

965
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:00,628
You were just trying
to protect your job.

966
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:03,884
No, listen. We still don't
know why this is happening.

967
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:05,877
It could destroy Zootopia.

968
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:07,675
You have the right
to remain silent.

969
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,965
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

970
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:17,890
Ladies and gentlemammals,

971
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:21,631
14 mammals went missing and
all 14 have been found...

972
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:25,841
by our newest recruit,
who will speak to you in a moment.

973
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,986
- I'm so nervous.
- Okay, press conference 101.

974
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:32,709
You wanna look smart, answer their question
with your own question

975
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:34,956
and then answer that question.

976
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:39,304
Like this: "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.
What can you tell us about the case?"

977
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:43,132
"Well, was this a tough case?
Yes, yes it was. You see?"

978
01:09:43,157 --> 01:09:45,225
You should be
up there with me.

979
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,639
We did this together.

980
01:09:46,664 --> 01:09:50,307
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

981
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,416
Funny you should say that.

982
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:59,895
Because, well, I've been thinking.
It would be nice to have a partner.

983
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:07,237
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

984
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:15,121
Officer Hopps.
It's time.

985
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:24,215
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer
who cracked the case.

986
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,729
Officer Judy Hopps.

987
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:31,656
Yes?

988
01:10:31,681 --> 01:10:33,449
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

989
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:38,594
Well, the animals in question...
Emm.

990
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:46,559
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.

991
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:48,795
Okay, so what is the connection?

992
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:53,112
Oh. All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

993
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:56,072
So predators are the
only ones going savage?

994
01:10:56,073 --> 01:10:58,281
That is accu..
Yes, that is accurate, yes.

995
01:10:58,306 --> 01:11:02,323
- Why? Why is this happening?
- We still don't know.

996
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:08,038
But, emm.
It may have something to do with biology.

997
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,761
What do you mean, biology?

998
01:11:09,786 --> 01:11:15,651
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.

999
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:18,346
In their DNA,
can you elaborate on that, please?

1000
01:11:18,371 --> 01:11:23,194
Yes. What I mean is
thousands of years ago

1001
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:30,670
Eh, predators survived through their...
agressive hunting instincts.

1002
01:11:30,695 --> 01:11:36,672
For whatever reason, they seem to be
reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

1003
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:42,619
Officer Hopps, could
it happen again?

1004
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:45,888
It is possible.
So, we must be vigilant.

1005
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:50,325
And we at the ZPD are prepered
and are here to protect you.

1006
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:52,601
- Will more mammals go savage?
- What is being done to protect us?

1007
01:11:52,664 --> 01:11:54,501
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1008
01:11:54,364 --> 01:11:56,604
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1009
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:59,882
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.

1010
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:05,279
- Was I okay?
- Oh, you did fine.

1011
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:07,986
That went so fast, I
didn't get a chance to

1012
01:12:08,011 --> 01:12:09,853
mention you or say anything
about how we...

1013
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:12,848
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1014
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:14,084
What do you mean?

1015
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:16,900
"Clearly there's a
biological component?"

1016
01:12:16,925 --> 01:12:21,891
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1017
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:23,712
Are you serious?

1018
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:26,207
I just stated the
facts of the case.

1019
01:12:26,232 --> 01:12:28,797
I mean, it's not like a
bunny could go savage.

1020
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:31,000
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

1021
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:35,251
- Nick, stop it, you're not like them.
- Oh, there's a 'them' now?

1022
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:38,307
You know what I mean,
you're not that kind of predator.

1023
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:39,905
The kind that needs
to be muzzled?

1024
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:44,313
The kind that makes you think you need
to carry around fox repellant?

1025
01:12:44,314 --> 01:12:47,683
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that
little item the first time we met.

1026
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:51,586
Look. Let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1027
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:55,080
Do you think I might go nuts?

1028
01:12:55,525 --> 01:13:01,139
You think I might go savage?
You think I might try to eat you?

1029
01:13:01,164 --> 01:13:02,325
Huh!

1030
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,520
I knew it, huh.

1031
01:13:07,871 --> 01:13:10,940
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh?

1032
01:13:10,941 --> 01:13:15,068
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1033
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:22,633
No, Nick.
Nick!

1034
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:25,062
Officer Hopps, were you just
threatened by that predator?

1035
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:26,731
No, he's my friend.

1036
01:13:26,756 --> 01:13:28,789
We can't even trust our own friends?

1037
01:13:28,814 --> 01:13:30,627
That is not what I said.
Please.

1038
01:13:30,628 --> 01:13:33,629
- Are we safe?
- Have any other foxes gone savage?

1039
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:38,233
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition.

1040
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:40,837
The victim of a mauling by
a savage polar bear.

1041
01:13:40,862 --> 01:13:45,519
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1042
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:50,433
Judy Hopps connected the violence
to traditionally predatory animals.

1043
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:55,470
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by
popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1044
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:59,403
- Go back to the forest, predator!
- I am from the savannah.

1045
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:01,590
Zootopia is a unique place.

1046
01:14:01,591 --> 01:14:07,839
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.
Where we celebrate our differences.

1047
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:10,498
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1048
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:14,179
The Zootopia I know
is better than this.

1049
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:17,039
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1050
01:14:21,478 --> 01:14:24,389
We don't know why these
attacks keep happening.

1051
01:14:24,414 --> 01:14:29,043
But it's irresponsible to label all
predators as savages.

1052
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:37,324
It's not my Emmitt.

1053
01:14:39,715 --> 01:14:42,385
We cannot let fear divide us.

1054
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:47,450
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1055
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:52,865
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.

1056
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:55,787
The mayor?
Why?

1057
01:14:55,812 --> 01:14:58,460
It would seem you've arrived.

1058
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:05,212
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?

1059
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:10,072
Uh. They thought it would be
better if a predator

1060
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:13,600
such as myself wasn't the first face
that you see

1061
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:15,878
when you walk into the ZPD.

1062
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:17,355
What?

1063
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,678
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1064
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:23,863
It's by the boiler.

1065
01:15:25,607 --> 01:15:27,123
Hopps1

1066
01:15:30,714 --> 01:15:32,644
<font color="#ffaa82">Integrity
Honesty
Bravery</font>

1067
01:15:32,669 --> 01:15:35,560
Emm.
I don't understand.

1068
01:15:35,585 --> 01:15:38,262
Our city is 90% prey, Judy,

1069
01:15:38,287 --> 01:15:41,933
and right now
they're just really scared.

1070
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:45,040
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.

1071
01:15:45,065 --> 01:15:52,190
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1072
01:15:56,071 --> 01:16:01,695
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.

1073
01:16:02,445 --> 01:16:05,515
I came here to make the world
a better place. But...

1074
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:07,402
... I think I broke it.

1075
01:16:07,427 --> 01:16:11,429
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1076
01:16:11,454 --> 01:16:15,840
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1077
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:18,877
Like you.

1078
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:28,346
With all due respect, sir,
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1079
01:16:28,371 --> 01:16:33,033
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.

1080
01:16:36,646 --> 01:16:40,415
- I don't deserve this badge.
- Hopps.

1081
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:43,552
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.

1082
01:16:43,553 --> 01:16:45,921
It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid.

1083
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:48,096
You can't quit.

1084
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:50,621
Thank you for the opportunity.

1085
01:17:09,612 --> 01:17:12,445
A dozen carrots.
Have a nice day.

1086
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,783
Come on.

1087
01:17:19,855 --> 01:17:22,163
Hey there, Jude.
Jude the Dude.

1088
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:25,398
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1089
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:29,264
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1090
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:32,289
Why did I think I could
make a difference?

1091
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:36,180
- Because you're a trier, that's why.
- You've always been a trier.

1092
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:38,006
Oh, I tried.

1093
01:17:38,007 --> 01:17:42,309
And it made life so much worse
for so many innocent predators.

1094
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:46,130
Oh, not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1095
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:50,318
Is that Gideon Grey?

1096
01:17:50,343 --> 01:17:52,540
Yeah, it sure is.
We work with him now.

1097
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:54,956
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it,

1098
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:57,017
- had you not opened our minds.
- That's right.

1099
01:17:57,042 --> 01:18:00,883
I mean, kid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1100
01:18:02,314 --> 01:18:06,748
That's...
That's really cool, you guys.

1101
01:18:07,412 --> 01:18:10,280
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1102
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:14,938
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1103
01:18:14,963 --> 01:18:18,119
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself

1104
01:18:18,144 --> 01:18:20,884
in the form of unchecked
rage and agression.

1105
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:23,443
I was a major jerk.

1106
01:18:23,853 --> 01:18:27,241
Well, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.

1107
01:18:28,724 --> 01:18:32,174
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1108
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:35,642
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that
<i>midnicampum holicithias.</i>

1109
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:36,747
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1110
01:18:36,772 --> 01:18:38,848
Well, now. There's a
four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1111
01:18:38,873 --> 01:18:42,043
My family always just
call them Night Howlers.

1112
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:44,539
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

1113
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,508
Oh.
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1114
01:18:46,509 --> 01:18:50,018
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1115
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:51,612
on acoount of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1116
01:18:51,637 --> 01:18:54,892
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids
and went completely nuts.

1117
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:57,485
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1118
01:18:57,486 --> 01:19:00,054
A bunny can go savage.

1119
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:03,524
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1120
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:07,605
Well, sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1121
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:11,065
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers.

1122
01:19:11,066 --> 01:19:14,143
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1123
01:19:14,168 --> 01:19:16,646
That's it! That's what
I've been missing!

1124
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:19,616
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hurry, come on!

1125
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:23,080
Oh. Thank you!
I love you, bye!

1126
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,847
- You catch any of that, Bon?
- Not one bit.

1127
01:19:29,872 --> 01:19:31,420
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1128
01:19:31,445 --> 01:19:34,378
I thought she was talking in
tongues or something.

1129
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,573
Who is it?

1130
01:19:52,598 --> 01:19:55,660
I need to find Nick.
Please.

1131
01:19:56,985 --> 01:19:58,419
Nick?

1132
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:00,477
Nick?

1133
01:20:02,284 --> 01:20:04,218
Oh, Nick.

1134
01:20:04,219 --> 01:20:08,456
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're toxic flowers.

1135
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:12,772
I think someone is targetting predators
on purpose and making them go savage.

1136
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:17,452
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?

1137
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:22,837
Wait, please don't..
I know you'll never forgive me.

1138
01:20:22,838 --> 01:20:24,805
And I don't blame you.

1139
01:20:24,806 --> 01:20:27,306
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1140
01:20:27,543 --> 01:20:33,045
It was ignorant, and irresponsible,
and small-minded.

1141
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:37,121
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.

1142
01:20:37,486 --> 01:20:39,954
I have to fix this.

1143
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:42,612
But I can't do it without you.

1144
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:46,867
And...
And after we're done...

1145
01:20:47,496 --> 01:20:50,340
you can hate me.
And...

1146
01:20:50,365 --> 01:20:52,058
And that'll be fine.

1147
01:20:52,083 --> 01:20:57,541
Because I was a horrible
friend and I hurt you.

1148
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:03,433
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right. All along.

1149
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:07,682
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1150
01:21:11,593 --> 01:21:15,202
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1151
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:20,494
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1152
01:21:20,495 --> 01:21:25,446
Don't worry, Carrots,
I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.

1153
01:21:27,222 --> 01:21:29,821
All right, get in here.

1154
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:35,910
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.

1155
01:21:35,935 --> 01:21:38,435
There we go, deep breath.

1156
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,792
Are you-Are you just
trying to steal the pen?

1157
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:42,737
Is that what this is?

1158
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:46,517
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off!
- I'm sorry.

1159
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:48,768
<font color="#ffc891">HOPPS
FAMILY FARM</font>

1160
01:21:51,033 --> 01:21:54,776
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Mmph.

1161
01:21:54,801 --> 01:21:57,841
- What's your plan?
- We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1162
01:21:57,866 --> 01:21:59,245
Okay, how?

1163
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:02,803
- Know this guy?
- Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody.

1164
01:22:02,804 --> 01:22:05,436
Ha-ha. Well, hello!
Step right up.

1165
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:07,408
Anything you need, I got it.

1166
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:09,043
All your favorite movies.

1167
01:22:09,044 --> 01:22:11,645
I've got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1168
01:22:11,646 --> 01:22:13,533
Hey, 15% off.
20!

1169
01:22:13,558 --> 01:22:15,496
Make me an offer.
Come on!

1170
01:22:15,521 --> 01:22:19,030
Well, well, look who it is,
the Duke of Bootleg.

1171
01:22:19,055 --> 01:22:20,219
What's it to you, Wilde?

1172
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:22,199
Shouldn't you be melting down
a Pawpsicle or something?

1173
01:22:22,224 --> 01:22:24,760
Hey, if it isn't
flopsy the copsie.

1174
01:22:24,785 --> 01:22:27,971
We both know those weren't only
onions I caught you stealing.

1175
01:22:27,996 --> 01:22:30,331
What were you gonna do with
those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1176
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:34,648
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton.
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1177
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:37,508
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1178
01:22:38,599 --> 01:22:39,819
Ice him.

1179
01:22:39,844 --> 01:22:42,825
Ahhh!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah!

1180
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:45,512
You dirty rat, why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1181
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:48,525
And the godmother to
my future granddaughter.

1182
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:51,318
- I'm gonna name her Judy.
- Ohhhh...

1183
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:53,379
Heh heh heh.
Ice this weasel.

1184
01:22:53,404 --> 01:22:56,099
Aww! All right, all right!
Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1185
01:22:56,124 --> 01:22:57,845
I stole the Night Howlers
so I could sell them.

1186
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,961
They offered me what I
couldn't refuse: Money.

1187
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:03,063
And to whom did you sell them?

1188
01:23:03,064 --> 01:23:06,150
A ram named Doug. We got
a drop spot underground.

1189
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:09,677
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1190
01:23:09,704 --> 01:23:12,038
He's unfriendly.

1191
01:23:21,809 --> 01:23:23,235
Come on.

1192
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:37,991
The weasel wasn't lying.

1193
01:23:38,016 --> 01:23:41,486
Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1194
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:28,189
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?

1195
01:24:28,616 --> 01:24:33,194
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.

1196
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:36,132
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast,
I can hit him.

1197
01:24:36,157 --> 01:24:41,201
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter
through the open window of a moving car.

1198
01:24:54,148 --> 01:24:57,601
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.

1199
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,684
You know, whichever comes first.

1200
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:02,992
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1201
01:25:03,017 --> 01:25:06,511
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1202
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:08,593
Hey. Wait, where you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!

1203
01:25:08,618 --> 01:25:10,849
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1204
01:25:11,225 --> 01:25:12,833
What are you looking at?
Hey!

1205
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,590
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it.

1206
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:17,904
Carrots.
Carrots.

1207
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:19,828
You better have the
extra foam this time.

1208
01:25:19,853 --> 01:25:20,882
HA!

1209
01:25:23,108 --> 01:25:24,163
Hey!
Open up!

1210
01:25:24,188 --> 01:25:26,723
What are you doing? You
just trapped us in here!

1211
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:28,718
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD.

1212
01:25:28,743 --> 01:25:31,944
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it.
- No, all of it.

1213
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:33,515
Wait, what?

1214
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,249
Oh, great, you're a
conductor now, huh?

1215
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:42,753
Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle
to get this rustbucket going.

1216
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:45,540
Well.
Hallelujah.

1217
01:25:45,565 --> 01:25:50,769
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!

1218
01:25:51,598 --> 01:25:52,948
Mission accomplished.

1219
01:25:52,973 --> 01:25:55,475
Would it be premature for me to
do a little victory toot-toot?

1220
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,301
All right.
One toot-toot.

1221
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:03,676
Well, I can cross that off
the bucket list.

1222
01:26:13,788 --> 01:26:16,428
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.

1223
01:26:17,959 --> 01:26:20,071
Maybe that's just hail.

1224
01:26:23,231 --> 01:26:24,713
Back off!

1225
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:31,097
Incoming!

1226
01:26:34,175 --> 01:26:36,100
- Carrots!
- Don't stop! Keep going.

1227
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,533
No, stop.
Please stop!

1228
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:39,759
Do not stop this car!

1229
01:26:39,784 --> 01:26:41,418
Ahhh!

1230
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:44,046
Owww!

1231
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,545
Whoa!

1232
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:04,634
- Speed up, Nick. Speed up!
- There's another train coming!

1233
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:07,063
Trust me, speed up.

1234
01:27:10,507 --> 01:27:12,437
Stop the train!

1235
01:27:13,737 --> 01:27:16,040
Hey.
Need some help?

1236
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:22,939
Oh, no. Oh, no no no.
Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1237
01:27:34,564 --> 01:27:36,899
I think this is our stop.

1238
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:49,002
Okay, maybe...
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1239
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,155
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.

1240
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:05,486
Yeah. All, except for this.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

1241
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:07,421
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
- Ow.

1242
01:28:07,446 --> 01:28:10,235
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.

1243
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,706
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1244
01:28:24,013 --> 01:28:28,051
- There it is.
- Judy. Judy!

1245
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:30,422
Mayor Bellwether.

1246
01:28:30,447 --> 01:28:33,873
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1247
01:28:33,898 --> 01:28:35,654
That's what's making them go savage.

1248
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,081
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job.

1249
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:40,790
Thank you, ma'am.

1250
01:28:44,727 --> 01:28:46,885
How did you know
where to find us?

1251
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,587
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.

1252
01:28:48,612 --> 01:28:54,284
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1253
01:28:58,381 --> 01:28:59,788
- Run.
- Run.

1254
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:02,166
Get them!

1255
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:07,175
Ah....

1256
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:09,435
Carrots!

1257
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:10,550
Aww.

1258
01:29:10,575 --> 01:29:12,928
Here, I got you.
Get in here.

1259
01:29:14,978 --> 01:29:17,299
Okay.
Now, just relax.

1260
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,415
Whoops.

1261
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,940
- Blueberry?
- Pass.

1262
01:29:22,358 --> 01:29:24,796
Come on out, Judy.

1263
01:29:24,821 --> 01:29:27,069
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.

1264
01:29:27,094 --> 01:29:28,959
I'm not gonna leave you behind,
that's not happening.

1265
01:29:28,984 --> 01:29:31,589
- I can't walk.
- Just.. We'll think of something.

1266
01:29:31,614 --> 01:29:34,449
We're on the same team, Judy.

1267
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:38,413
Underestimated.
Underappreciated.

1268
01:29:38,438 --> 01:29:41,072
Aren't you sick of it?

1269
01:29:43,559 --> 01:29:47,328
Predators.
They may be strong and loud.

1270
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:51,281
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1271
01:29:54,737 --> 01:30:00,809
Think about it. 90% of the population
united against a common enemy.

1272
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:03,310
We'll be unstoppable.

1273
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,518
Huh?

1274
01:30:08,684 --> 01:30:10,328
Over there!

1275
01:30:14,183 --> 01:30:15,291
Oh!

1276
01:30:17,255 --> 01:30:18,362
Ah!

1277
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:29,542
Well, you should have just
stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1278
01:30:29,573 --> 01:30:32,650
It really is too bad,
I did like you.

1279
01:30:32,675 --> 01:30:34,979
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

1280
01:30:35,004 --> 01:30:38,346
Oohhh.
No, of course not.

1281
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:39,863
He is.

1282
01:30:39,987 --> 01:30:42,754
No!
Oh, Nick?

1283
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:47,565
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the
Natural History Museum!

1284
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:50,407
Officer Hopps is down.
Please hurry!

1285
01:30:50,432 --> 01:30:52,453
No, Nick.
Don't do this. Fight it.

1286
01:30:52,478 --> 01:30:55,746
Oh, but he can't help it.
Can he?

1287
01:30:55,771 --> 01:31:01,227
Since predators are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1288
01:31:08,485 --> 01:31:09,774
Get back!

1289
01:31:11,514 --> 01:31:14,408
Gosh!
Think of the headline!

1290
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:18,505
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1291
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:23,368
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1292
01:31:23,393 --> 01:31:24,770
Yeah.
Pretty much.

1293
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:26,328
It won't work.

1294
01:31:26,353 --> 01:31:28,705
Fear always works.

1295
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:32,424
And I'll dart every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way.

1296
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:33,467
Ah!

1297
01:31:35,304 --> 01:31:38,109
Oh, Nick.
No.

1298
01:31:40,676 --> 01:31:42,607
Bye-bye, bunny.

1299
01:31:47,265 --> 01:31:48,526
Blahhh...

1300
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:52,768
Blood, blood, blood!
And death.

1301
01:31:52,793 --> 01:31:54,050
All right, you know you're milking it.

1302
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:55,746
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

1303
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:58,128
We got it up there,
thank you, yakety-yak.

1304
01:31:58,153 --> 01:31:59,983
You laid it all out beautifully.

1305
01:32:00,008 --> 01:32:00,895
What?

1306
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:03,952
Yeah. Oh, are-are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.

1307
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,574
What you've got
in the weapon there,

1308
01:32:05,599 --> 01:32:08,469
those are blueberries,
from my family's farm.

1309
01:32:08,494 --> 01:32:11,873
Mmmuch. They are delicious.
You should try some.

1310
01:32:11,874 --> 01:32:15,043
I framed Lionheart,
I can frame you too.

1311
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:17,375
It's my word against yours.

1312
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,520
Ooo.
Actually...

1313
01:32:19,545 --> 01:32:22,808
<i>And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

1314
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:25,496
- It's your word against yours.
- Huh?

1315
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:29,041
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
Boom!

1316
01:32:35,687 --> 01:32:38,352
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today,

1317
01:32:38,377 --> 01:32:42,536
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1318
01:32:42,561 --> 01:32:46,638
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1319
01:32:46,663 --> 01:32:49,253
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.

1320
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:51,794
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1321
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:53,289
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.

1322
01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:57,085
It was a classic doing the wrong thing
for the right reason kind of a deal.

1323
01:32:57,086 --> 01:33:01,489
In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers'
antidote is proving effective

1324
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:04,658
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1325
01:33:09,373 --> 01:33:12,106
Oh, Emmitt!

1326
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:16,926
Thank you.

1327
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:20,846
When I was a kid,

1328
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:24,540
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1329
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,417
Where everyone got along,

1330
01:33:26,442 --> 01:33:29,952
and anyone could be anything.

1331
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:36,290
Turns out, real life is a little bit more
complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1332
01:33:36,315 --> 01:33:39,209
Real life is messy.

1333
01:33:39,441 --> 01:33:42,075
We all have limitations.

1334
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,668
We all make mistakes.

1335
01:33:43,693 --> 01:33:47,991
Which means, hey, glass half full,
we all have a lot in common.

1336
01:33:48,016 --> 01:33:51,114
And the more we try to
understand one another.

1337
01:33:51,139 --> 01:33:54,038
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1338
01:33:55,097 --> 01:33:57,522
But we have to try.

1339
01:33:57,857 --> 01:34:00,777
So no matter what type
of animal you are.

1340
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:06,510
From the biggest elephant,
to our first fox.

1341
01:34:07,525 --> 01:34:09,791
I implore you.

1342
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:14,879
Try.....
Try to make the world a better place.

1343
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:16,507
<font color="#ffff80">OFFICER
Nicholas P. Wilde</font>

1344
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:22,609
Look inside yourself and recognize
that change starts with you.

1345
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:29,709
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.

1346
01:34:32,221 --> 01:34:34,424
- Yeh!
- Yeh!

1347
01:34:36,224 --> 01:34:40,164
All right, all right, enough.
Shut it!

1348
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:43,772
We have some new recruits
with us this morning.

1349
01:34:43,797 --> 01:34:47,611
Including our first fox.
Who cares.

1350
01:34:47,636 --> 01:34:50,555
Hah. You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1351
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,518
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1352
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:54,068
Assignments.

1353
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:58,973
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Tundratown SWAT.

1354
01:34:58,974 --> 01:35:03,007
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard.
Undercover.

1355
01:35:03,267 --> 01:35:07,363
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.

1356
01:35:07,395 --> 01:35:09,163
Dismissed.

1357
01:35:09,506 --> 01:35:11,326
Just kidding!

1358
01:35:11,351 --> 01:35:15,020
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1359
01:35:15,063 --> 01:35:17,454
Find him.
Shut him down.

1360
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:21,706
So are all the rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1361
01:35:22,778 --> 01:35:25,272
Oops.
Sorry.

1362
01:35:25,397 --> 01:35:27,608
Heh heh.
Sly bunny.

1363
01:35:27,633 --> 01:35:29,070
Dumb fox.

1364
01:35:29,095 --> 01:35:30,692
You know you love me.

1365
01:35:30,717 --> 01:35:32,406
Do I know that?

1366
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:35,508
Yes.
Yes, I do.

1367
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:53,960
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,
I hope you have a good explanation.

1368
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:58,814
Flash, Flash.
Hundred Yard Dash!

1369
01:36:01,389 --> 01:36:04,343
Nick...

1370
01:36:06,306 --> 01:36:08,607
