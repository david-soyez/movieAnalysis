Comparing the Demographically sampled and Context-governed Parts of the Spoken BNC

FrCo    = Frequency (per million words) in demographically sampled conversational speech 
Ra      = Range across conversational speech (maximum of 4 sectors)
          Range across task-oriented speech (maximum of 6 sectors)
DiCo    = Dispersion (Juilland's D) in demographically sampled conversational speech
LL      = Distinctiveness, measured in log likelihood (varying from 0.00 to 1.00)
FrTO    = Frequency (per million words) in context-governed speech (task-oriented)
DiCG    = Dispersion (Juilland's D) in context-governed speech (task-oriented)

NOTE: The list is restricted to lemmas with a frequency of 120 per
million or more in one of the two speech subcorpora
